You can configure a router in multiple ways. Because cloud-hosted and self-hosted routers share the common foundation of Apollo Router Core, all routers support declarative configuration with a YAML file, usually named `router.yaml`. Differences between configuring cloud-hosted and self-hosted routers:

- A cloud-hosted router is managed by Apollo and fully integrated with GraphOS, so its configuration is provided via the GraphOS Studio IDE.
- A self-hosted router is launched via command line, so its configuration includes command-line options and environment variables.

|   | Cloud-Hosted Router   | Self-Hosted Router  |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Studio IDE | &#x2705; | &#x274C; |  
| YAML file | &#x2705; | &#x2705; |
| Command-line options | &#x274C; | &#x2705; |
| Environment variables | &#x274C; | &#x2705; |


## YAML file-based configuration

Both cloud-hosted and self-hosted routers support YAML file-based configuration. You can edit a YAML file named `router.yaml` to declaratively configure your router. 

- For cloud-hosted routers, use GraphOS Studio to edit `router.yaml`.
- For self-hosted routers, edit a local `router.yaml` and run your router with the `--config` flag:

  ```bash
  ./router --config router.yaml
  ```

<Tip>

For self-hosted routers, run `router config schema` to print a JSON schema of all configuration options supported by your router.

To learn more about router configuration options, go to [router configuration reference docs](/graphos/reference/router/configuration).


## Configuring a self-hosted router

You provide the configuration for a self-hosted router when you run a router binary or deploy a router image. 

From a command line, the router accepts configuration flags and environment variables.

The `--config` flag sets a path to a YAML configuration file. Use this flag to customize non-default settings for your router.

  ```bash
  ./router --config router.yaml
  ```

GraphOS Routers must set the following environment variables so that they can fetch their supergraph schemas from GraphOS:
  - `APOLLO_KEY` sets the graph API key to use for authenticating with GraphOS
  - `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` sets the graph ref of the graph and variant in GraphOS 

You can run your router from the command line with these environment variables:

  ```bash
  APOLLO_KEY="..." APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="..." ./router
  ```

To learn more about configuration options available to self-hosted routers, go to [router configuration reference docs](/graphos/reference/router/configuration).

## Configuring a cloud-hosted router

You can manage a cloud router's configuration from [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content):

- Open Studio and go to the **Cloud Router** page
- In the **General** tab, you can view: 

  - The URL of your router's GraphQL API endpoint. Every cloud router URL is on a subdomain of `apollographos.net`
  - Your router's status and launch history 

In the **Configuration** tab, you can manage:

  - Secrets
  - Your router's YAML-base configuration

    - A router on the **Serverless** plan has the following options available:
        - HTTP headers
        - CORS rules
        - Subgraph error inclusion
        - Introspection
