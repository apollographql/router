description: Configure logging in the Apollo Router. Set the log level and output format
---

The Apollo Router provides built-in support for logging with support for:

* [Configurable log level](#log-level)
* [stdout output](./stdout) with [configurable output formats](./stdout/#logging-output-format)

## Log level

The Apollo Router accepts a command-line argument to set its log level:

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `--log`

</td>
<td>

The log level, indicating the _most_ severe log message type to include. In ascending order of verbosity, can be one of: `off`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace`.

The default value is `info`.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

The router also accepts both `RUST_LOG` and `APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG` environment variables with the same possible values as the command-line argument. The precedence is as follows (top to bottom):
 - RUST_LOG
 - command-line argument
 - APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG

`RUST_LOG` is supported for advanced users with specific filtering requirements who may wish to see log messages from crates consumed by the router. Most users should use the command-line argument or APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG. Both of these options constrain log output to the router.

To be clear:

```
RUST_LOG=apollo_router::debug
APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG=debug
--log=debug
```

are equivalent, as are:

```
RUST_LOG=hyper=debug,apollo_router::info,h2=trace
APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG=hyper=debug,info,h2=trace
--log=hyper=debug,info,h2=trace
```

In both examples, the actual filter used by the router is as defined in the RUST_LOG entry.

For more information about specifying filters for more granular control over Apollo Router logging, see the [Env Logger documentation](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/).


## Logging common configuration

Common logging configuration contains global settings for all exporters:

* [Service name](#service-name)
* [Resource attributes](#resource)

### Service name

Set a service name for your router logging so they can be easily searched and found in your metrics dashboards. 

The service name can be set by an environment variable or in `router.yaml`, with the following order of precedence (first to last):

1. `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable
2. `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable
3. `telemetry.exporters.logging.common.service_name` in `router.yaml`

      <ExpansionPanel title="Example service_name">

      Example setting service name in `telemetry.exporters.logging.common.service_name`:

      ```yaml title="router.yaml"
      telemetry:
        exporters:
          logging:
            common:
              # (Optional) Set the service name to easily find logs related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
              service_name: "router" #highlight-line
      ```

      </ExpansionPanel>


4. `telemetry.exporters.logging.common.resource` in `router.yaml`

      <ExpansionPanel title="Example resource">

      Example setting service name in `telemetry.exporters.logging.common.resource`:

      ```yaml title="router.yaml"
      telemetry:
        exporters:
          logging:
            common:
              resource:
                # (Optional) Set the service name to easily find logs related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
                "service.name": "router" #highlight-line
      ```

      </ExpansionPanel>

If the service name isn't explicitly set, then by default the service name will be set to `unknown_service:apollo_router` (or `unknown_service` if the executable name cannot be determined).

### Resource attribute

A resource attribute is a set of key-value pairs that provide additional information to an exporter. Application performance monitors (APM) may interpret and display resource information. 

In `router.yaml`, resource attributes are set in `telemetry.exporters.logging.common.resource`. For example:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
     logging:
       common:
         resource:
           "environment.name": "production"
           "environment.namespace": "{env.MY_K8_NAMESPACE_ENV_VARIABLE}"
```

For OpenTelemetry conventions for resources, see [Resource Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/resource/README.md).
