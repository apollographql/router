> ⚠️ Apollo Router support for subgraph error inclusion is currently experimental.

The Apollo Router provides experimental support for subgraph error inclusion.

By default, the router will redact subgraph errors from clients. This is to prevent potential
leaks of information to the client. This plugin makes it possible to configure your router so
that subgraph errors are propagated to the client. This may be done for all subgraphs or on a
per subgraph basis.

## Configuration
To configure subgraph error inclusion add the `include_subgraph_errors` plugin to `your router.yaml`:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
plugins:
  experimental.include_subgraph_errors:
    all: true # Propagate errors for all subraphs
    subgraphs: 
      products: false # Do not propagate errors from the products subgraph
```

Note that configuration in the `subgraphs` section will take precedence over that in the `all` section.

### Subgraph error reporting

If a subgraph error is not included (default behaviour) then errors in subgraphs will be replaced with a default error containing this message: "Subgraph errors redacted"
