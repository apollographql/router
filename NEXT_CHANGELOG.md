## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó
### Fix naming inconsistency of telemetry.metrics.common.attributes.router ([Issue #2076](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2076))

Mirroring the rest of the config `router` should be `supergraph`

```yaml
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      attributes:
        router: # old
```
becomes
```yaml
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      attributes:
        supergraph: # new
```

### CLI structure changes ([Issue #2123](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2123))

As the Router gains functionality the limitations of the current CLI structure are becoming apparent.

There is now a separate subcommand for config related operations:
* `config`
  * `schema` - Output the configuration schema
  * `upgrade` - Upgrade the configuration with optional diff support.

`router --schema` has been deprecated and users should move to `router config schema`.

## üöÄ Features

### Provide multi-arch (amd64/arm64) Docker images for the Router ([Issue #1932](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2138))

From the next release, our Docker images will be multi-arch.

### Add a supergraph configmap option to the helm chart ([PR #2119](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2119))

Adds the capability to create a configmap containing your supergraph schema. Here's an example of how you could make use of this from your values.yaml and with the `helm` install command.

```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: APOLLO_ROUTER_SUPERGRAPH_PATH
    value: /data/supergraph-schema.graphql

extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: supergraph-schema
    mountPath: /data
    readOnly: true

extraVolumes:
  - name: supergraph-schema
    configMap:
      name: "{{ .Release.Name }}-supergraph"
      items:
        - key: supergraph-schema.graphql
          path: supergraph-schema.graphql
```

With that values.yaml content, and with your supergraph schema in a file name supergraph-schema.graphql, you can execute:

```
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --namespace router-test --set-file supergraphFile=supergraph-schema.graphql router-test oci://ghcr.io/apollographql/helm-charts/router --version 1.0.0-rc.9 --values values.yaml
```

### Configuration upgrades ([Issue #2123](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2123))

Occasionally we will make changes to the Router yaml configuration format.
When starting the Router if the configuration can be upgraded it will do so automatically and display a warning:

```
2022-11-22T14:01:46.884897Z  WARN router configuration contains deprecated options: 

  1. telemetry.tracing.trace_config.attributes.router has been renamed to 'supergraph' for consistency

These will become errors in the future. Run `router config upgrade <path_to_router.yaml>` to see a suggested upgraded configuration.
```

Note: If a configuration has errors after upgrading then the configuration will not be upgraded automatically.

From the CLI users can run:
* `router config upgrade <path_to_router.yaml>` to output configuration that has been upgraded to match the latest config format.
* `router config upgrade --diff <path_to_router.yaml>` to output a diff e.g.
```
 telemetry:
   apollo:
     client_name_header: apollographql-client-name
   metrics:
     common:
       attributes:
-        router:
+        supergraph:
           request:
             header:
             - named: "1" # foo
```

There are situations where comments and whitespace are not preserved. This may be improved in future.

## üêõ Fixes

### Improve errors when subgraph returns non-GraphQL response with a non-2xx status code ([Issue #2117](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2117))

The error response will now contain the status code and status name. Example: `HTTP fetch failed from 'my-service': 401 Unauthorized`

## üõ† Maintenance
## üìö Documentation

### Docs: Update cors match regex example ([Issue #2151](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2151))

The docs CORS regex example now displays a working and safe way to allow `HTTPS` subdomains of `api.example.com`.

### update documentation to reflect new examples structure ([Issue #2095](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2133))

We recently updated the examples directory structure. This fixes the documentation links to the examples. It also makes clear that rhai subgraph fields are read-only, since they are shared resources.
