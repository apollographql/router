### Use less recursion in GraphQL parser ([Issue #4142](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/4142))

This updates the Router with the latest `apollo-parser` version,
which removes unnecessary use of recursion for parsing repeated syntax elements
such as enum values and union members in type definitions.
Some documents that used to hit the parserâ€™s recursion limit will now successfully parse.
