# Development

The **Apollo Router** is a configurable, high-performance **graph router** for a [federated graph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/):

## Crates

 *   `configuration` - Config model and loading.
 *   `query planner` - Query plan model and a caching wrapper for calling out to the nodejs query planner.
 *   `execution` - Converts a query plan to a stream.
 *   `server` - Handles requests,
     obtains a query plan from the query planner,
     obtains an execution pipeline,
     returns the results

## Binaries

 *   `router` - Starts a server.

## Development

We recommend using [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to make sure your
nodejs and rust versions are correct.  The versions currently used to compile
are specified in [.tool-versions](.tool-versions). To set up your toolchain
run:

```shell
asdf plugin add rust
asdf plugin add nodejs
asdf install
asdf reshim
```

The `router-bridge` dependency requires building a nodejs project. This should
happen automatically, but may take some time.

Set up your git hooks:

```shell
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/
```

### Getting started

Use `cargo build --all-targets` to build the project.

Some tests run against the existing Node.js implementation of the Apollo Router. This
requires that the `federation-demo` project is running:

 *  If you have Docker and Docker Compose installed:

    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    **Note:** `-d` is for running into background. You can remove `-d` if you
    have issues and you want to see the logs or if you want to run the service
    in foreground.

 *  Otherwise:

    You will need Node.js and npm to be installed. It is known to be working on
    Node.js 16 and npm 7.18.

  ```shell
  git submodule sync --recursive
  git submodule update --recursive --init
  cd dockerfiles/federation-demo/federation-demo
  npm install;
  npm run start
  ```

### Run Apollo Router against the docker-compose or Node.js setup

Once the subgraphs are up and running, run Apollo Router with this command:

```shell
cargo run --release -- -s ./examples/local.graphql -c examples/config-jaeger.yml
```

Go to https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer to make queries and
http://localhost:16686/ to reach Jaeger.

### Strict linting and license compliance

While developing locally doc warnings and other lint checks are disabled.
This limits the noise generated while exploration is taking place.

When you are ready to create a PR, run a build with strict checking enabled,
and check for license compliance.

Use `cargo xtask all` to run all of the checks the CI will run.

The CI checks require `cargo-deny` and `cargo-about` which can both be installed by running:
- `cargo install cargo-deny`
- `cargo install cargo-about`

They also need you to have the federation-demo project up and running,
as explained in the Getting started section above.
