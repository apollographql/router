## üöÄ Features

### Apollo uplink: Configurable schema poll timeout ([PR #2271](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2271))

In addition to the url and poll interval, Uplink poll timeout can now be configured via command line arg and env variable:

```bash
        --apollo-uplink-timeout <APOLLO_UPLINK_TIMEOUT>
            The timeout for each of the polls to Apollo Uplink. [env: APOLLO_UPLINK_TIMEOUT=] [default: 30s]
```

It defaults to 30 seconds.

## üêõ Fixes

### Keep the error path when redacting subgraph errors ([Issue #1818](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1818))

Error redaction was erasing the error's path, which made it impossible to affect the errors to deferred responses. Now the redacted errors keep the path. Since the response shape for the primary and deferred responses are defined from the API schema, there is no possibility of leaking internal schema information here.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Return more consistent errors ([Issue #2101](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2101))

Change some of our errors we returned by following [this specs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/errors/). It adds a `code` field in `extensions` describing the current error.
