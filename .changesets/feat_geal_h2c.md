### HTTP/2 Cleartext protocol (H2C) support for subgraph connections ([Issue #3535](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/3535))

The router can now connect to subgraphs over HTTP/2 Cleartext (H2C), which uses the HTTP/2 binary protocol directly over TCP **without TLS**, which is a mode of operation desired with some service mesh configurations (e.g., Istio, Envoy) where the value of added encryption is unnecessary. To activate it, set the `experimental_http2` option to `http2_only`.
