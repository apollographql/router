Learn how to upgrade from your Apollo Router 1.x deployment to Apollo Router 2.x.

## What's different?

TBD: Write some text here about what is different and why.

## How do I upgrade?

TBD: Write a list of all considerations and possible changes a user must make (configuration, deployment, etc.) to upgrade to 2.x. Add some text here about various changes and how they impact 1.x deployments. Perhaps talk about tooling that automates upgrade (config in particular).
