title: Configuring the Apollo Router
description: Command arguments and YAML config
---

> For router installation instructions, see the [quickstart](../quickstart/).

You run the Apollo Router with the following command (assuming you're in the same directory as the `router` executable):

```bash
./router --config router.yaml --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
```

Arguments for this command are described below.

## Environment variables

If you're using the Apollo Router with [managed federation](/federation/managed-federation/overview/) and GraphOS, set these environment variables in the startup command:

```bash
APOLLO_KEY="..." APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="..." ./router
```

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Environment Variable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr class="required">
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`

</td>
<td>

The graph ref for the GraphOS graph and variant that the router fetches its supergraph schema from (e.g., `docs-example-graph@staging`).

**Required** if using managed federation.

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="required">
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `APOLLO_KEY`

</td>
<td>

The [graph API key](/graphos/api-keys/#graph-api-keys) that the router should use to authenticate with GraphOS when fetching its supergraph schema.

**Required** if using managed federation.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Command-line options

Where indicated, some of these options can also be provided via an environment variable. If an option is provided _both_ ways, the command-line value takes precedence.

</tbody>
</table>

### Dev mode defaults

> **⚠️ Do not set the `--dev` option in production!** If you want to replicate any specific dev mode functionality in production, instead make the corresponding modifications to your [YAML config file](#yaml-config-file).

Setting the [`--dev`](#--dev) flag is equivalent to running `./router --hot-reload` with the following configuration options:

```yaml
sandbox:
  enabled: true
homepage:
  enabled: false
supergraph:
  introspection: true
include_subgraph_errors:
  all: true
plugins:
  # Enable with the header, Apollo-Expose-Query-Plan: true
  experimental.expose_query_plan: true
```

## `config` subcommands

The Apollo Router provides a set of subcommands for interacting with its configuration. You run these subcommands with the following syntax:

```
./router config schema
./router config upgrade <path-to-config-file.yaml>
```

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Subcommand</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td>

##### `schema`

</td>
<td>

Prints a JSON schema representation of the router's full supported configuration format.

Use this schema to enable [configuration awareness in your text editor](#configuration-awareness-in-your-text-editor).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `upgrade`

</td>
<td>

Takes a config file created for a _previous_ version of the Apollo Router and outputs the corresponding configuration for the _current_ version.

For details, see [Upgrading your router configuration](#upgrading-your-router-configuration).

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

## YAML config file

The Apollo Router takes an optional YAML configuration file as input via the [`--config`](#-c----config) option:

```bash
./router --config router.yaml
```

This file enables you to customize numerous aspects of your router's behavior, covered in the subsections below.

> If you pass the [`--hot-reload`](#--hr----hot-reload) flag to the `router` command, your router automatically restarts whenever changes are made to its configuration file.

### Listen address

By default, the Apollo Router starts an HTTP server that listens on `127.0.0.1:4000`. You can specify a different address by setting `supergraph.listen`:

#### IPv4

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
  # The socket address and port to listen on
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
```

#### IPv6

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
  # The socket address and port to listen on.
  # Note that this must be quoted to avoid interpretation as an array in YAML.
  listen: '[::1]:4000'
```

#### Unix socket

> Listening on a Unix socket is not supported on Windows.

```yaml title="router_unix.yaml"
supergraph:
  # Absolute path to a Unix socket
  listen: /tmp/router.sock
```

### Endpoint path

By default, the router starts an HTTP server that exposes a `POST`/`GET` endpoint at path `/`.

You can specify a different path by setting `supergraph.path`:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
  # The path for GraphQL execution
  # (Defaults to /)
  path: /graphql
```

The path must start with `/`.

Path parameters and wildcards are supported. For example:

- `/:my_dynamic_prefix/graphql` matches both `/my_project_a/graphql` and `/my_project_b/graphql`.
- `/graphql/*` matches `/graphql/my_project_a` and `/graphql/my_project_b`.
- `/g*` matches `/graphql` and `/gateway`.

> **Note:** The router does _not_ support wildcards in the _middle_ of a path (e.g., `/*/graphql`). Instead, use a path parameter (e.g., `/:parameter/graphql`).

### Introspection

By default, the router does _not_ resolve introspection queries. You can enable introspection like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
# Do not enable introspection in production!
supergraph:
  introspection: true
```

### Landing pages

The Apollo Router can serve any of the following landing pages to browsers that visit its [endpoint path](#endpoint-path):

- A basic landing page that displays an example query `curl` command (default)

    ```yaml title="router.yaml"
    # This is the default behavior. You don't need to include this config.
    homepage:
      enabled: true
    ```

- _No_ landing page

    ```yaml title="router.yaml"
    homepage:
      enabled: false
    ```

- [Apollo Sandbox](/graphos/explorer/sandbox), which enables you to explore your schema and compose operations against it using the Explorer

    Note the additional configuration required to use Sandbox:

    ```yaml title="router.yaml"
    sandbox:
      enabled: true

    # Sandbox uses introspection to obtain your router's schema.
    supergraph:
      introspection: true

    # Sandbox requires the default landing page to be disabled.
    homepage:
      enabled: false
    ```

    > ⚠️ **Do not enable Sandbox in production!** Sandbox requires enabling introspection, which is strongly discouraged in production environments.

### Subgraph routing URLs

By default, the Apollo Router obtains the routing URL for each of your subgraphs from the composed supergraph schema you provide it. In most cases, no additional configuration is required.

However, if you _do_ need to override a particular subgraph's routing URL (for example, to handle changing network topography), you can do so with the `override_subgraph_url` option:

```yaml
override_subgraph_url:
  organizations: http://localhost:8080
  accounts: "${env.ACCOUNTS_SUBGRAPH_HOST_URL}"
```

In this example, the `organizations` subgraph URL is overridden to point to `http://localhost:8080`, and the  `accounts` subgraph URL is overridden to point to a new URL using [variable expansion](#variable-expansion). The URL specified in the supergraph schema is ignored.

Any subgraphs that are _omitted_ from `override_subgraph_url` continue to use the routing URL specified in the supergraph schema.

If you need to override the subgraph URL at runtime on a per-request basis, you can use [request customizations](../customizations/overview/#request-path) in the `SubgraphService` layer.

### Caching

By default, the Apollo Router stores the following data in its in-memory cache to improve performance:

- Generated query plans
- Automatic persisted queries (APQ)
- Introspection responses

You can configure certain caching behaviors for generated query plans and APQ (but not introspection responses). For details, see [In-memory caching in the Apollo Router](./in-memory-caching/).

**If you have a GraphOS Enterprise plan,** you can also configure a Redis-backed _distributed_ cache that enables multiple router instances to share cached values. For details, see [Distributed caching in the Apollo Router](./distributed-caching/).

### Safelisting with persisted queries

You can enhance your graph's security by maintaining a persisted query list (PQL), an operation safelist made by your first-party apps. As opposed to automatic persisted queries (APQ) where operations are automatically cached, operations must be preregistered to the PQL. Once configured, the router checks incoming requests against the PQL.

See [Safelisting with persisted queries](./persisted-queries) for more information.

### HTTP header rules

See [Sending HTTP headers to subgraphs](./header-propagation/).

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

See [Configuring CORS in the Apollo Router](./cors).

### Defer support

See [Apollo Router support for `@defer`](../executing-operations/defer-support/#disabling-defer).

### Subscription support

See [GraphQL subscriptions in the Apollo Router](../executing-operations/subscription-support/#router-setup).

### External coprocessing

See [External coprocessing in the Apollo Router](../customizations/coprocessor/).

### OpenTelemetry tracing

See [Tracing in the Apollo Router](./tracing/).

### TLS

The Apollo Router supports TLS to authenticate and encrypt communications, both on the client side and the subgraph side. It works automatically on the subgraph side if the subgraph URL starts with `https://`.

TLS support is configured in the `tls` section, under the `supergraph` key for the client side, and the `subgraph` key for the subgraph side, with configuration possible for all subgraphs and overriding per subgraph.

The list of supported TLS versions and algorithms is static, it cannot be configured.

Supported TLS versions:
* TLS 1.2
* TLS 1.3

Supported cipher suites:
* TLS13_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* TLS13_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
* TLS13_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
* TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
* TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

Supported key exchange groups:
* X25519
* SECP256R1
* SECP384R1

#### TLS termination

Clients can connect to the router directly over HTTPS, without terminating TLS in an intermediary. You can  configure this in the `tls` configuration section:

```yaml
tls:
  supergraph:
    certificate: ${file./path/to/certificate.pem}
    certificate_chain: ${file./path/to/certificate_chain.pem}
    key: ${file./path/to/key.pem}
```

The router expects the file referenced in the `certificate_chain` value to be a combination of several PEM certificates concatenated together into a single file (as is commonplace with Apache TLS configuration).

#### Overriding certificate authorities for subgraphs

The router verifies TLS connections to subgraphs using the list of certificate authorities the system provides. You can override this list with a combination of global and per-subgraph settings:

```yaml
tls:
  subgraph:
    # Use these certificate authorities unless overridden per-subgraph
    all:
      certificate_authorities: "${file./path/to/ca.crt}"
    # Override global setting for individual subgraphs
    subgraphs:
      products:
        certificate_authorities: "${file./path/to/product_ca.crt}"
```

The router expects the file referenced in the `certificate_chain` value to be a combination of several PEM certificates concatenated together into a single file (as is commonplace with Apache TLS configuration).

You can only configure these certificates via the router's configuration since using `SSL_CERT_FILE` also overrides certificates for sending telemetry and communicating with Apollo Uplink.

> **Note**: If the subgraph is presenting a self-signed certificate, it must be generated with the proper file extension and with `basicConstraints` disabled.
> You can generate it with the following command line command from a certificate signing request, in this example, `server.csr`:

```
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt -extfile v3.ext
```

You can generate a `v3.ext` extension file like so:

```
subjectKeyIdentifier   = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer:always
# this has to be disabled
# basicConstraints       = CA:TRUE
keyUsage               = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment, keyAgreement, keyCertSign
subjectAltName         = DNS:local.apollo.dev
issuerAltName          = issuer:copy
```

> Make sure to change the `subjectAltName` field to the subgraph's name.
This produces the file as `server.crt` which can be used in `certificate_authorities`.

#### TLS client authentication for subgraph requests

The router support mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) with the subgraphs. This means that it can authenticate itself to the subgraph using a certificate chain and a cryptographic key. It can be configured as follows:

```yaml
tls:
  subgraph:
    # Use these certificates and key unless overridden per-subgraph
    all:
      client_authentication:
        certificate_chain: ${file./path/to/certificate_chain.pem}
        key: ${file./path/to/key.pem}
    # Override global setting for individual subgraphs
    subgraphs:
      products:
        client_authentication:
          certificate_chain: ${file./path/to/certificate_chain.pem}
          key: ${file./path/to/key.pem}
```

### Request limits

> **Request limits are currently in [preview](/resources/product-launch-stages#preview).**
>
> To set request limits, you must run v1.17 or later of the Apollo Router. [Download the latest version.](../quickstart#download-options)

The Apollo Router supports enforcing three types of request limits for enhanced security:

- Network-based limits
- Lexical, parser-based limits
- Semantic, operation-based limits (this is an [Enterprise feature](../enterprise-features/))

The router rejects any request that violates at least one of these limits.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
limits:
  # Network-based limits
  experimental_http_max_request_bytes: 2000000 # Default value: 2 MB

  # Parser-based limits
  parser_max_tokens: 15000 # Default value
  parser_max_recursion: 4096 # Default value

  # Operation-based limits (Enterprise only)
  max_depth: 100
  max_height: 200
  max_aliases: 30
  max_root_fields: 20
```

#### Operation-based limits (Enterprise only)

See [this article](./operation-limits/).

#### Network-based limits

##### `http_max_request_bytes`

> **This configuration is currently [experimental](/resources/product-launch-stages#experimental-features).**

Limits the amount of data read from the network for the body of HTTP requests,
to protect against unbounded memory consumption.
This limit is checked before JSON parsing.
Both the GraphQL document and associated variables count toward it.

The default value is `2000000` bytes, 2 MB.

Before increasing this limit significantly consider testing performance
in an environment similar to your production, especially if some clients are untrusted.
Many concurrent large requests could cause the Router to run out of memory.

#### Parser-based limits

##### `parser_max_tokens`

Limits the number of tokens a query document can include. This counts _all_ tokens, including both [lexical and ignored tokens](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Language.Source-Text.Lexical-Tokens).

The default value is `15000`.

##### `parser_max_recursion`

Limits the deepest level of recursion allowed by the router's GraphQL parser to prevent stack overflows. This corresponds to the deepest nesting level of any single GraphQL operation or fragment defined in a query document.

The default value is `4096`.

In the example below, the `GetProducts` operation has a recursion of three, and the `ProductVariation` fragment has a recursion of two. Therefore, the _max_ recursion of the query document is three.

```graphql
query GetProducts {
  allProducts { #1
    ...productVariation
    delivery { #2
      fastestDelivery #3
    }
  }
}

fragment ProductVariation on Product {
  variation { #1
    name #2
  }
}
```

Note that the router calculates the recursion depth for each operation and fragment _separately_.  Even if a fragment is included in an operation, that fragment's recursion depth does not contribute to the _operation's_ recursion depth.

> In versions of the Apollo Router prior to 1.17, this limit was defined via the config option `experimental_parser_recursion_limit`.

### GraphQL Validation Mode

We are experimenting with a new GraphQL validation implementation written in Rust. The legacy implementation is part of the JavaScript query planner. This is part of a project to remove JavaScript from the Router to improve performance and memory behavior.

To opt in to the new validation implementation, set:

```yaml {4,8} title="router.yaml"
experimental_graphql_validation_mode: new
```

This is an experimental option while we are still finding edge cases in the new implementation, but it will become the default in the future.

### Plugins

You can customize the Apollo Router's behavior with [plugins](../customizations/overview). Each plugin can have its own section in the configuration file with arbitrary values:

```yaml {4,8} title="example-plugin-router.yaml"
plugins:
  example.plugin:
    var1: "hello"
    var2: 1
```

### Variable expansion

You can reference variables directly in your YAML config file. This is useful for referencing secrets without including them in the file.

Currently, the Apollo Router supports expansion of environment variables and file paths. Corresponding variables are prefixed with `env.` and `file.`, respectively.

The router uses Unix-style expansion. Here are some examples:

- `${env.ENV_VAR_NAME}` expands to the value of environment variable `ENV_VAR_NAME`.
- `${env.ENV_VAR_NAME:-some_default}` expands to the value of environment variable `ENV_VAR_NAME`, or falls back to the value `some_default` if the environment variable is not defined.
- `${file.a.txt}` expands to the contents of the file `a.txt`.
- `${file.a.txt:-some_default}` expands to the contents of the file `a.txt`, or falls back to the value `some_default` if the file does not exist.

Variable expansions are valid only for YAML _values_, not keys:

<!-- TODO: Add back doc config validation when https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1374 is fixed -->
```yaml
supergraph:
  listen: "${env.MY_LISTEN_ADDRESS}" #highlight-line
example:
  password: "${env.MY_PASSWORD}" #highlight-line
```

### Reusing configuration

You can reuse parts of your configuration file in multiple places using standard YAML aliasing syntax:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
headers:
  subgraphs:
    products:
      request:
        - insert: &insert_custom_header
            name: "custom-header"
            value: "something"
    reviews:
      request:
        - insert: *insert_custom_header
```

Here, the `name` and `value` entries under `&insert_custom_header` are reused under `*insert_custom_header`.

## Configuration awareness in your text editor

The Apollo Router can generate a JSON schema for config validation in your text editor. This schema helps you format the YAML file correctly and also provides content assist.

Generate the schema with the following command:

```bash
./router config schema > configuration_schema.json
```

After you generate the schema, configure your text editor. Here are the instructions for some commonly used editors:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings)
- [Emacs](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-yaml)
- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/json.html#ws_json_using_schemas)
- [Sublime](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-yaml)
- [Vim](https://github.com/Quramy/vison)

## Upgrading your router configuration

New releases of the Apollo Router might introduce breaking changes to the [YAML config file's](#yaml-config-file) expected format, usually to extend existing functionality or improve usability.

**If you run a new version of your router with a configuration file that it no longer supports:**

1. The router emits a warning on startup.
2. The router attempts to translate your provided configuration to the new expected format.
    - If the translation succeeds without errors, the router starts up as usual.
    - If the translation fails, the router terminates.

If you encounter this warning, you can use the `router config upgrade` command to see the new expected format for your existing configuration file:

```bash
./router config upgrade <path_to_config.yaml>
```

You can also view a diff of exactly which changes are necessary to upgrade your existing configuration file:

```bash
./router config upgrade --diff <path_to_config.yaml>
```
