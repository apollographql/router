## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Bind the Sandbox on the same endpoint as the Supergraph [#1785](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1785)

We have rolled back an addition that we released in yesteday‚Äôs `v1.0.0-rc.0` which allowed Sandbox to be on a custom listener address.
In retrospect, we believe it was premature to make this change without considering the broader impact of this change which touches on CORS and some developer experiences bits.
We would like more time to make sure we provide you with the best experience before we attempt to make the change again.

Sandbox will continue to be on the same listener address as the GraphQL listener.

If you have updated your configuration for `v1.0.0-rc.0` and enabled the sandbox here is a diff of what has changed:

```diff
sandbox:
-  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
-  path: /
  enabled: true
# make sure homepage is disabled!
homepage:
  enabled: false
# do not forget to enable introspection,
# otherwise the sandbox won't work!
supergraph:
  introspection: true
```

Note this means you can either enable the Homepage, or the Sandbox, but not both.

## üöÄ Features
## üêõ Fixes

### Respect supergraph path for kubernetes deployment probes (#1787)

For cases where you configured the `supergraph.path` for the router when using the helm chart, the liveness 
and readiness probes continued to use the default path of `/` and so the start failed.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Update apollo-router-scaffold to use the published router crate [PR #1782](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1782)

Now that apollo-router version "1.0.0-rc.0" is released on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/apollo-router), we can update scaffold to it relies on the published crate instead of the git tag.

### Refactor Configuration validation [#1791](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1791)

Instantiating `Configuration`s is now fallible, because it will run consistency checks on top of the already run structure checks.
