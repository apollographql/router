By default, the Apollo Router collects anonymous usage data to help us improve the product.

The Apollo Router doesn't collect any personally identifiable information such as API keys, graph names, or file paths. 

<Tip>

**To opt out of data collection,** set the `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` environment variable to `true` in each environment where you run the Apollo Router.

</Tip>

For more information on how this data is collected and used, see [Apollo's privacy policy](https://www.apollographql.com/privacy-policy/).

## Collected data

Unless you opt out, the Apollo Router reports the following data:

- The execution command that was run _(excluding any identifiable arguments such as file-system paths or profile names)_
- The version of `router` that was executed
- The configuration properties which have been referenced, but limited to types which could not contain personally identifiable information (e.g., certain scalar types; a property which is set to `true` not the value if it is a `string`)
- A unique, anonymized **machine identifier**, which is the same for every command run on the same machine
- A unique, anonymized **session identifier**, which is different for every command
- The SHA-256 hash of the directory that `router` was executed from
- The SHA-256 hash of the contents of the supergraph schema
- The operating system `router` was executed on
- The CI system `router` was executed on, if any
