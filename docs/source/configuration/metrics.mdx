title: Collecting metrics in the Apollo Router
---

The Apollo Router provides built-in support for metrics collection via [Prometheus](#using-prometheus) and [OpenTelemetry Collector](#using-opentelemetry-collector).

## Using Prometheus

You can use [Prometheus and Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) to collect metrics and visualize the router metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      # (Optional, default to "apollo-router") Set the service name to easily find metrics related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
      service_name: "apollo-router"
      # (Optional)
      service_namespace: "apollo"
    prometheus:
      # By setting this endpoint you enable the prometheus exporter
      # All our endpoints exposed by plugins are namespaced by the name of the plugin
      enabled: true
      listen: 127.0.0.1:9090
      path: /metrics
```

### Using in a containers environment

The prometheus endpoint listens to 127.0.0.1 by default, which won't allow connections issued from a network.
While this is a safe default, _other containers won't be able to access the prometheus endpoint_, which will disable metric scraping.

You can change this by setting:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      # By setting this endpoint you enable other containers and pods to access the prometheus endpoint
      enabled: true
      listen: 0.0.0.0:9090
      path: /metrics
```

Assuming you're running locally:

1. Run a query against the router.
2. Navigate to [http://localhost:9090/metrics](http://localhost:9090/metrics) to see something like:

```
# HELP apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds Total number of HTTP requests made.
# TYPE apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds histogram
apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"} 1
apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.9"} 1
---SNIP---
```

> Note that if you haven't run a query against the router yet, you'll see a blank page because no metrics have been generated!

### Currently available metrics
The following metrics are available using Prometheus:

- HTTP router request duration: `apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket`
- HTTP request duration by subgraph: `apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket` with attribute `subgraph`
- Total number of HTTP requests by HTTP Status: `apollo_router_http_requests_total`
- Number of currently connected clients: `apollo_router_session_count_total`
- Number of in flight GraphQL requests: `apollo_router_session_count_active`
- Number of cache hits for different `kind` of cache (`apq`, `query planner`, `introspection`) and for different `storage` (`memory`, `redis`): `apollo_router_cache_hit_count`
- Number of cache misses for different `kind` of cache (`apq`, `query planner`, `introspection`) and for different `storage` (`memory`, `redis`): `apollo_router_cache_miss_count`
- Time to hit the cache for different `kind` of cache (`apq`, `query planner`, `introspection`) and for different `storage` (`memory`, `redis`), in seconds: `apollo_router_cache_hit_time`
- Time to miss the cache for different `kind` of cache (`apq`, `query planner`, `introspection`) and for different `storage` (`memory`, `redis`), in seconds: `apollo_router_cache_miss_time`
- Time spent processing a request, outside of waiting for external or subgraph requests, in seconds (`apollo_router_processing_time`)
- Number of triggered timeouts: `apollo_router_timeout`

## Using OpenTelemetry Collector

You can send metrics to [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) for processing and reporting metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    otlp:
      # Either 'default' or a URL
      endpoint: default

      # Optional protocol. Only grpc is supported currently.
      # Setting to http will result in configuration failure.
      protocol: grpc

      # Optional Grpc configuration
      grpc:
        domain_name: "my.domain"
        key: ""
        ca: ""
        cert: ""
        metadata:
          foo: bar

      # Optional batch_processor configuration
      batch_processor:
        scheduled_delay: 100ms
        max_concurrent_exports: 1000
        max_export_batch_size: 10000
        max_export_timeout: 100s
        max_queue_size: 10000
```

Remember that `file.` and `env.` prefixes can be used for expansion in config yaml. e.g. `${file.ca.txt}`.

## Adding custom attributes/labels

You can add custom attributes (OpenTelemetry) and labels (Prometheus) to your generated metrics. You can apply these across _all_ requests, or you can selectively apply them based on the details of a particular request. These details include:

- The presence of a particular HTTP header
- The value at a particular JSON path within a request or response body (either from a subgraph or from the router itself)
  - [See examples of querying a JSON path.](#example-json-path-queries)
- A custom value provided via the router plugin context

Examples of all of these are shown in the file below:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      attributes:
        supergraph: # Attribute configuration for requests to/responses from the router
          static:
            - name: "version"
              value: "v1.0.0"
          request:
            header:
              - named: "content-type"
                rename: "payload_type"
                default: "application/json"
              - named: "x-custom-header-to-add"
          response:
            body:
              # Apply the value of the provided path of the router's response body as an attribute
              - path: .errors[0].extensions.status
                name: error_from_body
          context:
            # Apply the indicated element from the plugin chain's context as an attribute
            - named: my_key
        subgraph: # Attribute configuration for requests to/responses from subgraphs
          all:
            static:
              # Always apply this attribute to all metrics for all subgraphs
              - name: kind
                value: subgraph_request
            errors: # Only work if it's a valid GraphQL error (for example if the subgraph returns an http error or if the router can't reach the subgraph)
              include_messages: true # Will include the error message in a message attribute
              extensions: # Include extensions data
                - name: subgraph_error_extended_type # Name of the attribute
                  path: .type # JSON query path to fetch data from extensions
                - name: message
                  path: .reason
            # Will create this kind of metric for example apollo_router_http_requests_error_total{message="cannot contact the subgraph",service_name="apollo-router",subgraph="my_subgraph_name",subgraph_error_extended_type="SubrequestHttpError"}
          subgraphs:
            my_subgraph_name: # Apply these rules only for the subgraph named `my_subgraph_name`
              request:
                header:
                  - named: "x-custom-header"
                body:
                  # Apply the value of the provided path of the router's request body as an attribute (here it's the query)
                  - path: .query
                    name: query
                    default: UNKNOWN
```

### Example JSON path queries

Let's say you have a JSON request body with the following structure:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "unwanted": 7,
      "wanted": { "x": 3, "y": 7 },
      "array": [3, 2, 1]
    },
    {
      "isImportant": true
    }
  ]
}
```

To fetch the value of the field `isImportant`, the corresponding path is `.items[1].isImportant`.

To fetch the value of the field `x`, the corresponding path is `.items[0].wanted.x`.

JSON path queries always begin with a period `.`

## Adding custom resources

Resources are similar to [attributes](#adding-custom-attributeslabels), but there are more globals. They're configured directly on the metrics exporter, which means they're always present on each of your metrics.

As an example, it can be useful to set a `environment_name` resource to help you identify metrics related to a particular environment:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      resources:
        environment_name: "production"
```

> [See OpenTelemetry conventions for resources.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/README.md)
>
> For example, if you want to use a Datadog agent and specify a service name, you should set the `service.name` resource as shown above and described in the conventions document.

## Adding custom metrics

You can add your own custom metrics by creating a Rust plugin and following [these instructions](../customizations/native/#add-custom-metrics).
