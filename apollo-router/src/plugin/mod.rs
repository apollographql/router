//! Plugin system for the router.
//!
//! Provides a customization mechanism for the router.
//!
//! Requests received by the router make their way through a processing pipeline. Each request is
//! processed at:
//!  - router
//!  - query planning
//!  - execution
//!  - subgraph (multiple in parallel if multiple subgraphs are accessed)
//!  stages.
//!
//! A plugin can choose to interact with the flow of requests at any or all of these stages of
//! processing. At each stage a [`Service`] is provided which provides an appropriate
//! mechanism for interacting with the request and response.
