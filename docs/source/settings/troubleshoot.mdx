This section contains a non exhaustive list of common issues when running the router for the first time.

You can browse the current / closed issues in the [apollographql/router github repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues). If your issue isn't mentionned here, please [file one](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/new/choose)!

### I can perform queries in Apollo studio, but it doesn't work with my website / an other graphql client ðŸ¤”

If the client is browser based, it might be a CORS issue.

CORS can be configured in the `configuration.yaml` file:

Here is for example how to add localhost to the list of available origins:

```yaml
# examples/nodejs/configuration.yaml
server:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
  cors:
    origins:
      - https://studio.apollographql.com
      - https://localhost
```

The exhaustive list of settings you can tweak is available in the [configuration](configuration) section of the documentation.

Restart the Apollo router and try to perform the query again! ðŸš€
