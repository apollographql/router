title: Self-Hosting the Apollo Router
subtitle: How to deploy the router on your own infrastructure
---

Apollo Router is a graph runtime that you can deploy in your own infrastructure.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["<b>Router</b>"]);
  serviceB[Products<br/>API];
  serviceC[Reviews<br/>API];
  router -->|Sub-query| serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.->|Query| router;
  class clients secondary;
```

For each version of the Apollo Router, Apollo provides:

- [A Helm chart for Kubernetes](#kubernetes-using-helm)
- [A binary](#local-binary)
- [A Docker image](#container)

## Kubernetes using Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Apollo provides a Helm chart with each release of Apollo Router in the GitHub Container Registry. Since router v0.14.0, Apollo has released each router Helm chart as an Open Container Initiative (OCI) image in `oci://ghcr.io/apollographql/helm-charts/router`.

Follow our [Kubernetes quickstart](/graphos/routing/kubernetes/quickstart) to deploy the router with a Helm chart.

## Docker

Apollo provides Docker images for each release of Apollo Router. The images are available via GitHub, downloadable from the `ghcr.io/apollographql/router` and the [router repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/router). Both debug and production images are provided.

For more information on deploying using your container environment:

- [Docker](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker)
- [AWS using Elastic Container Service (ECS)](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/aws)
- [Azure using Azure Container App](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/azure)
- [GCP using Google Cloud Run](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/gcp)

## Local binary

Running the Apollo Router directly from its binary speeds up local development and enables embedded use cases where containers are unavailable. 

Follow the [quickstart](/graphos/routing/get-started) to run a router binary.
