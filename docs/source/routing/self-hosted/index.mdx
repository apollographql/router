A self-hosted GraphOS Router or Apollo Router Core enables you to fully manage the runtime infrastructure and deployments of your supergraph.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["<b>Router</b>"]);
  serviceB[Products<br/>API];
  serviceC[Reviews<br/>API];
  router -->|Sub-query| serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.->|Query| router;
  class clients secondary;
```

<Note>

Self-hosting the GraphOS Router requires a current GraphOS [Enterprise or Free plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing).

## Downloading and installing a self-hosted router

Apollo provides the router as both a binary and as images to run in your containerized deployments.

### Router binary
=======
For each version of the Apollo Router, Apollo provides:

- [A Helm chart for Kubernetes](#kubernetes-using-helm)
- [A binary](#local-binary)
- [A Docker image](#container)

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Kubernetes Using Helm
>>>>>>> 20aaf5a1 (draft: changes to the kubernetes docs)

Apollo provides a binary of the router for multiple platforms. You can download the router bundle, extract the router binary, and run it. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
To learn more, follow the steps in the [self-hosted router installation](/graphos/reference/router/self-hosted-install) reference to run a router binary with a sample supergraph schema.

### Router container image

Apollo provides container images of the router to deploy in self-hosted environments. The router images are hosted on GitHub in its container repository. Each router release includes both production and debug images. 

To learn more, go to the [containerization overview](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization).

- If running with Docker, go to the [Docker](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker) docs to learn how to run router images.
- If running with Kubernetes, go to the [Kubernetes](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/kubernetes) docs to learn to deploy with router Helm charts.

## Next steps

- To prepare your routers for production deployment, follow the guides in [Production Readiness](/graphos/platform/production-readiness/checklist) docs.
=======
Follow the [Kubernetes quickstart](/graphos/routing/kubernetes/quickstart) to deploy the router with a Helm chart.
=======
## Kubernetes using Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Apollo provides a Helm chart with each release of Apollo Router in the GitHub Container Registry. Since router v0.14.0, Apollo has released each router Helm chart as an Open Container Initiative (OCI) image in `oci://ghcr.io/apollographql/helm-charts/router`.

Follow our [Kubernetes quickstart](/graphos/routing/kubernetes/quickstart) to deploy the router with a Helm chart.

## Docker

Apollo provides Docker images for each release of Apollo Router. The images are available via GitHub, downloadable from the `ghcr.io/apollographql/router` and the [router repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/router). Both debug and production images are provided.

For more information on deploying using your container environment:

- [Docker](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker)
- [AWS using Elastic Container Service (ECS)](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/aws)
- [Azure using Azure Container App](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/azure)
- [GCP using Google Cloud Run](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/gcp)

## Local binary

Running the Apollo Router directly from its binary speeds up local development and enables embedded use cases where containers are unavailable. 

Follow the [quickstart](/graphos/routing/get-started) to run a router binary.
