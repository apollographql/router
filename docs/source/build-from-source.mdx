If we don't provide a [prebuilt executable](./quickstart/#1-download-and-extract-the-apollo-router-binary) for your system or architecture, you can build the executable from source.

## 1. Install prerequisites

To compile the Apollo Router binary on your machine, you need the following:

- **Git.** Github provides a tutorial on [how to install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
- **The Rust language.** Head over to [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) to install Rust.
- **Rover** [Installation instructions](https://github.com/apollographql/rover#installation-methods)

## 2. Clone the repository

From your preferred directory, run the following:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apollographql/router.git
cd router
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

> ⚠️ The Apollo Router project uses submodules. Execute all of these commands to make sure your submodules are initialized and up to date!

## 3. Build and run the executable

From the repository's root directory, you can run the following command to build and run the Apollo Router:

```bash
cargo run -- --supergraph ./examples/graphql/supergraph.graphql
```

You'll see output similar to the following:

```

```

That's it! Visit `localhost:4000` to open the [Apollo Explorer Sandbox](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/). You can inspect the entire example federated graph and run your first queries against the Apollo Router.
