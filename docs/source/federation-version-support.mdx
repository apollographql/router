title: Federation version support in the Apollo Router
---

The Apollo Router supports supergraph schemas that are generated via Apollo Federation 2.x [composition](/federation/federated-types/composition/). This composition algorithm is usually performed by one of the following:

* Apollo Studio (for supergraphs that use [managed federation](./managed-federation/overview/))
* The Rover CLI (for _non_-managed supergraphs)

Apollo Federation is an evolving project, and its composition algorithm regularly receives new features and bug fixes. To help ensure that your router fully supports its supergraph schema, you should regularly update it to the latest stable version.

## Support table

The table below shows which version of federation each router release is compiled against. You might encounter issues if your router uses an earlier version of federation than the version that was used to compose its supergraph schema.

## Federation 1 support

Federation 2.x composition is backward compatible with Federation 1.x subgraph schemas, so you can use the Apollo Router with any valid Federation 1.x supergraph.

> If your Federation 1.x supergraph _doesn't_ work with the Apollo Router, see possible causes in [Backward compatibility in Federation 2](/federation/federation-2/backward-compatibility/).
