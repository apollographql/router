## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Exit the router after logging panic details ([PR #1602](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1602))

If the router panics, it can leave the router in an unuseable state.

Terminating after logging the panic details is the best choice here.

### Remove `activate()` from the plugin API ([PR #1569](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1569))

Recent changes to configuration reloading means that the only known consumer of this API, telemetry, is no longer using it.

Let's remove it since it's simple to add back if later required.

### Rename TestHarness methods ([PR #1579](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1579))

Some methods of `apollo_router::TestHarness` were renamed:

* `extra_supergraph_plugin` ‚Üí `supergraph_hook`
* `extra_execution_plugin` ‚Üí `execution_hook`
* `extra_subgraph_plugin` ‚Üí `subgraph_hook`

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1579

### `Request` and `Response` types from `apollo_router::http_ext` are private ([Issue #1589](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1589))

These types were wrappers around the `Request` and `Response` types from the `http` crate.
Now the latter are used directly instead.

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1589

### Changes to `IntoHeaderName` and `IntoHeaderValue` ([PR #1607](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1607))

Note: these types are typically not use directly, so we expect most user code to require no change.

* Move from `apollo_router::http_ext` to `apollo_router::services`
* Rename to `TryIntoHeaderName` and `TryIntoHeaderValue`
* Make contents opaque
* Replace generic `From<T: Display>` conversion with multiple specific conversions
  that are implemented by `http::headers::Header{Name,Value}`.

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1607

### QueryPlan::usage_reporting and QueryPlannerContent are private ([Issue #1556](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1556))

These items have been removed from the public API of `apollo_router::services::execution`.

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1568

### Many structs and enums are now `#[non_exhaustive]` ([Issue #1550](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1550))

This means we may add struct fields or enum variants in the future.
To prepare for that eventuality:

When using a struct pattern (such as for deconstructing a value into its fields),
use `..` to allow further fields:

```diff
-let PluginInit { config, supergraph_sdl } = init;
+let PluginInit { config, supergraph_sdl, .. } = init;
```

Or use field access instead:

```diff
-let PluginInit { config, supergraph_sdl } = init;
+let config = init.config;
+let supergraph_sdl = init.supergraph_sdl;
```

When constructing a struct, use a builder or constructor method instead of struct literal syntax:

```diff
-let error = graphql::Error {
-    message: "something went wrong".to_string(),
-    ..Default::default()
-};
+let error = graphql::Error::builder()
+    .message("something went wrong")
+    .build();
```

When matching on an enum, add a wildcard match arm:

```diff
 match error {
     ApolloRouterError::StartupError => "StartupError",
     ApolloRouterError::HttpServerLifecycleError => "HttpServerLifecycleError",
     ApolloRouterError::NoConfiguration => "NoConfiguration",
     ApolloRouterError::NoSchema => "NoSchema",
     ApolloRouterError::ServiceCreationError(_) => "ServiceCreationError",
     ApolloRouterError::ServerCreationError(_) => "ServerCreationError",
+    _ => "other error",
}
```

### Some error enums or variants were removed ([Issue #81](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/81))

They were not used anymore in the public API (or at all).

## üöÄ Features

### instrument the rhai plugin with a tracing span ([PR #1598](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1598))

If you have an active rhai script in your router, you will now see a "rhai plugin" tracing span.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1598

## üêõ Fixes

### Only send one report for a response with deferred responses ([PR #1576](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1576))

The router was sending one report per response (even deferred ones), while Studio was expecting one report for the entire
response. The router now sends one report, that measures the latency of the entire operation.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1576

### Include formatted query plan when exposing the query plan ([#1557](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1557))

Move the location of the `text` field when exposing the query plan and fill it with a formatted query plan.

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1557

### Fix typo on HTTP errors from subgraph ([#1593](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1593))

Remove the closed parenthesis at the end of error messages resulting from HTTP errors from subgraphs.

By [@nmoutschen](https://github.com/nmoutschen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1593

### Only send one report for a response with deferred responses ([PR #1596](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1596))

deferred responses come as multipart elements, send as individual HTTP response chunks. When a client receives one chunk,
it should contain the next delimiter, so the client knows that the response can be processed, instead of waiting for the
next chunk to see the delimiter.

## üõ† Maintenance


### Re-organize our release steps checklist ([PR #1605](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1605))

We've got a lot of manual steps we need to do in order to release the Router binarys, but we can at least organize them meaningfuly for ourselves to follow!  This is only a Router-team concern today!
