Hello! Let's run Apollo Router for the first time, using the simple scenario of developing locally.

In this guide, you will:

- Download and run the router as a binary.
- Create a supergraph schema.
- Create a router YAML configuration file.
- Run the router in development mode.
- Make a query to the running router.

## 1. Download the router

Let's start by downloading and running the router locally.

1. Download the latest version of the router binary with a single command line:

    ```bash showLineNumbers=false
    curl -sSL https://router.apollo.dev/download/nix/latest | sh
    ```

    <ExpansionPanel title="Download a specific router version">

    To download and install a specific version of router, set the version in the download URL path.

    For example, to download router v2.0.0:

    ```bash showLineNumbers=false
    curl -sSL https://router.apollo.dev/download/nix/v2.0.0 | sh
    ```

    </ExpansionPanel>

    Optionally, go to [router releases](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases) in GitHub to download and extract a bundle.

1. Check that your router downloaded successfully by running the `router` binary from your project's root directory:

    ```bash showLineNumbers=false
    ./router --version
    ```


## 2. Create a supergraph schema

A router needs a schema for the federated graph, or _supergraph_, that it's orchestrating. This guide uses an example supergraph schema, which you download and provide to the router. 

The example supergraph schema is composed of four subgraphs: `accounts`, `inventory`, `products`, and `reviews`. It outlines the types (`Query`, `Mutation`, `Product`, `Review`, `User`) and their fields, and it specifies which subgraph is responsible for resolving each piece of data using Apollo Federation directives (`@join__*`, `@link`).

1. From your project's root directory, run the following to download and save an example supergraph schema:

  ```bash showLineNumbers=false
  curl -sSL https://supergraph.demo.starstuff.dev/ > supergraph.graphql
  ```

<ExpansionPanel title="Example supergraph schema contents">

## 3. Create a router config

The router's many features are configurable via a YAML configuration file. You set your options declaratively in YAML, then point your router to it at startup.

Let's customize a common setting: the router's _supergraph listen address_. It's the network address and port on which the router receives client requests. By default the address is `127.0.0.1:4000`. As an exercise, let's change the port to `5555`.

1. In your same working directory, create a file named `router.yaml`. Open it for editing.
1. Add the following configuration that sets `supergraph.listen` to `127.0.0.1:5555`:

  ```yaml title="router.yaml"
  supergraph:
    listen: 127.0.0.1:5555
  ```

## 4. Run the router


Let's run the router in dev mode, using both the supergraph schema and YAML configuration files you created: 

1. Run the router with these command-line options:
    - `--dev` enables dev mode
    - `--config` provides the path to your YAML configuration file
    - `--supergraph` provides the path to your supergraph schema

    ```sh showLineNumbers=false
    ./router --dev --config router.yaml --supergraph supergraph.graphql
    ```

    <ExpansionPanel title="About dev mode">

    Running router with `--dev` is the same as using the following configuration:

    ```yaml title="Same configuration as --dev"
    sandbox:
      enabled: true
    homepage:
      enabled: false
    supergraph:
      introspection: true
    include_subgraph_errors:
      all: true
    plugins:
      # Enable with the header, Apollo-Expose-Query-Plan: true
      experimental.expose_query_plan: true
    ```

1. Check that your router is running, with output similar to the example: 

    <ExpansionPanel title="Example router output">

    ```

    </ExpansionPanel>

## 5. Make a query

When the router runs in dev mode, it hosts an [Apollo Sandbox](/graphos/explorer/sandbox/) automatically. Sandbox has a browser-based IDE, Explorer, that you can use to write and send real GraphQL queries to your graph. 


1. Go to the URL your router is running at, [`http://127.0.0.1:5555`](http://127.0.0.1:5555). Sandbox should be running there.

1. Copy and paste the example query into the **Operation** pane of Explorer:

    ```graphql
    query Query {
      recommendedProducts {
        inStock
        name
        price
        reviews {
          author {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Click **Query** to run the query, then check for its response in the **Response** pane.

    <img
      className="screenshot"
      alt="Apollo Sandbox IDE showing successful query and response at the end of the router quickstart"
      src="../images/router-quickstart-sandbox.jpg"
      width="700"
    />

That's it! You've successfully sent a query to a router running a development graph and received a response.


## Next steps

Now that you've run the router locally, explore more about deployment and configuration:

- Deploy the router [in your own infrastructure](/graphos/routing/self-hosted) with containers and/or Helm.
- [Configure runtime features](/router/configuration/overview) of the router.
