title: Health checks in the Apollo Router
description: Determining the router's status
---

Health checks are often used by load balancers to determine whether a server is available and ready to start serving traffic.

Because GraphQL queries can be sent as `GET` requests, a GraphQL query acts as an excellent health check. We recommend sending a simple query as a `GET` request with an appropriate `Content-type: application/json` header:

```
/?query={__typename}
```

You can optionally use a different query string that includes fields from one or more of your subgraphs. This has the added benefit of exercising the router's entire request lifecycle. Make sure to include the `Content-type: application/json` header in your request to meet the requirements for [CSRF protection](./csrf/).

## Testing with `curl`

The following example demonstrates using the `curl` command to send a basic health check query to an Apollo Router instance running at `127.0.0.1:4000`:

```sh
$ curl -v -H 'content-type: application/json' "http://127.0.0.1:4000/?query=\{__typename\}"
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:4000...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 4000 (#0)
> GET /?query={__typename} HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:4000
> User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
> Accept: */*
> content-type: application/json
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< vary: origin
< content-type: application/json
< content-length: 31
< date: Tue, 13 Sep 2022 16:50:35 GMT
<
* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
{"data":{"__typename":"Query"}}
```

The key lines to observe here are the HTTP status code of 200:

```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

And the `data` response as well:

```json
{"data":{"__typename":"Query"}}
```

## Using with Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, you can configure health checks by setting `readinessProbe` and `livenessProbe` on the `containers` object of the resource definition:

```yaml
      # ... snipped for partial example ...
      containers:
        - name: router
          # ... snipped for partial example ...
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
              protocol: TCP
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              httpHeaders:
                - name: Content-Type
                  value: application/json
              # Customize this query string as needed.
              path: "/?query={__typename}"
              port: 80
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              httpHeaders:
                - name: Content-Type
                  value: application/json
              # Customize this query string as needed.
              path: "/?query={__typename}"
              port: 80
          # ... snipped for partial example ...
```

See a more complete example in our [Kubernetes documentation](../containerization/kubernetes/).

## Using with Docker

Docker has a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction that tells Docker how to test whether a container is still working. These are defined in the `Dockerfile` when building your container:

```
HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  "http://127.0.0.1:41123/?query=\{__typename\}" || exit 1
```

We don't define these in our example `Dockerfile`s, because they aren't commonly used. You can add them to your own images as needed.
