title: Subgraph error inclusion
---

> ⚠️ Apollo Router support for subgraph error inclusion is currently experimental.

By default, the Apollo Router redacts the details of subgraph errors in its responses to clients. The router instead returns a default error with the following message:

```
Subgraph errors redacted
```

This redaction prevents potential leaks of sensitive information to the client. Using the `include_subgraph_errors` plugin, you can configure the router to propagate subgraph errors to clients instead. You can do this for all subgraphs, or on a per-subgraph basis.

## Configuration

To configure subgraph error inclusion, add the `include_subgraph_errors` plugin to your [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file), like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
plugins:
  experimental.include_subgraph_errors:
    all: true # Propagate errors from all subraphs
    subgraphs:
      products: false # Do not propagate errors from the products subgraph
```

Any configuration under the `subgraphs` key takes precedence over configuration under the `all` key. In the example above, subgraph errors are included from all subgraphs _except_ the `products` subgraph.
