## 🚀 Features

### Always deduplicate variables ([Issue #2387](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2387))

Variable deduplication allows the router to reduce the number of entities that are requested from subgraphs if some of them are redundant, and as such reduce the size of subgraph responses. It has been available for a while but was not active by default. This is now always on.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2445

### Add optional `Access-Control-Max-Age` header to CORS plugin ([Issue #2212](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2212))

Adds new option called `max_age` that is used like this:
```
cors:
  max_age: 86400secs
```

## 🐛 Fixes

### Fix panic in schema parse error reporting ([Issue #2269](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2269))

In order to support introspection,
some definitions like `type __Field { … }` are implicitly added to schemas.
This addition was done by string concatenation at the source level.
In some cases like unclosed braces, a parse error could be reported at a position
beyond the size of the original source.
This would cause a panic because only the unconcatenated string
is given the the error reporting library `miette`.

Instead, the Router now parses introspection types separately
and “concatenates” definitions at the AST level.

### Always accept compressed subgraph responses  ([Issue #2415](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2415))

Subgraph response decompression was only supported when subgraph request compression was configured. This is now always active.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2450

### Fix handling of root query operation not named `Query`

With such a schema, some parsing code in the Router would incorrectly
return an error because it was assuming the default name.
Similarly with a root mutation operation not named `Mutation`.

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2459

### Remove the `locations` field from subgraph errors ([Issue #2297](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2297))

Subgraph errors can come with a `locations` field indicating which part of the query was causing issues, but it refers to the subgraph query generated by the query planner, and we have no way of translating it to locations in the client query, so this field is removed for now.

### `health-check` renamed to `health_check` ([Issue #2161](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2161))

The health_check key in router.yaml has been renamed to snake case for consistency. 

Before:
```yaml
health-check:
  enabled: true
```

After:
```yaml
health_check:
  enabled: true
```

## 📚 Documentation

### Documentation on how to propagate headers between subgraph services ([Issue #2128](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2128))

Migrating headers between subgraph services is possible via Rhai script. An example has been added to the header propagation page.

By [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2446

### Added documentation for listening on IPv6 ([Issue #1835](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1835))

Added documentation for listening on IPv6
```yaml
supergraph:
  # The socket address and port to listen on. 
  # Note that this must be quoted to avoid interpretation as a yaml array.
  listen: '[::1]:4000'
```

## 🛠 Maintenance

### Parse schemas and queries with `apollo-compiler`

The Router now uses the higher-level representation from `apollo-compiler`
instead of using the AST from `apollo-parser` directly.
This is a first step towards replacing a bunch of code that grew organically
during the Router’s early days, with a general-purpose library with intentional design.
Internal data structures are unchanged for now.
Parsing behavior has been tested to be identical on a large corpus
of production schemas and queries.
