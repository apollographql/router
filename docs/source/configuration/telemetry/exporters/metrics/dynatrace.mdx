subtitle: Configure the Dynatrace exporter for metrics
description: Configure the Dynatrace exporter for metrics via OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) in the Apollo Router.
---

Enable and configure the [OTLP exporter](./otlp) for metrics in the Apollo Router for use with [Dynatrace](https://dynatrace.com/).

For general tracing configuration, refer to [Router Metrics Configuration](./overview).

## Dynatrace configuration

To configure the router:

- Enable the [OTLP exporter](./otlp#configuration)
- Set `temporality: delta` (Using _Delta_ is required as _Cumulative_ temporality is **not** supported by Dynatrace)
- Set the `protocol` as `http` (Dynatrace [doesn't currently support](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/extend-dynatrace/opentelemetry/getting-started/otlp-export) gRPC)
- Provide your [Dynatrace endpoint](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/dynatrace-api/environment-api/opentelemetry/post-metrics) (e.g., ensuring that it contains `{your-environment-id}` in the hostname and ends in `/api/v2/otlp/v1/metrics`) 
- Provide your Dynatrace API token in the `Authorization` header (the header should start with [`Api-Token` and then your Dynatrace token](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/extend-dynatrace/opentelemetry/getting-started/otlp-export#authentication-export-to-activegate)

For example:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    metrics:
      otlp:
        enabled: true
        temporality: delta
        # Endpoint for your region.
        endpoint: <dynatrace-endpoint>
        protocol: http
        http:
          headers:
            Authorization: Api-Token <dynatrace-token>
```

<Note>

You must specify `protocol: http` or the exporter will fail to connect to Dynatrace.  You must use `temporality: delta` or some metrics will fail to be delivered to your deployment. 
 Additionally, if your Dynatrace endpoint does not contain a port, you **must** explicitly include `:443` as the port after the host address. For example: `https://subdomain.live.dynatrace.com:443/api/v2/otlp/v1/metrics`.

</Note>

For more details about Dynatrace configuration, see [Dynatrace's docs on OpenTelemetry configuration](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/extend-dynatrace/opentelemetry/getting-started/otlp-export).
