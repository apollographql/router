## üöÄ Features

### Add support for urlencode/decode to rhai engine ([Issue #2052](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2052))

### **Experimental** ü•º External cache storage in Redis ([PR #2024](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2024))

implement caching in external storage for query plans, introspection and APQ. This is done as a multi level cache, first in
memory with LRU then with a redis cluster backend. Since it is still experimental, it is opt-in through a Cargo feature.

## üêõ Fixes

### Fix `Float` input-type coercion for default values with values larger than 32-bits ([Issue #2087](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2087))

A regression has been fixed which caused the Router to reject integers larger than 32-bits used as the default values on `Float` fields in input types.

In other words, the following will once again work as expected:

```graphql
input MyInputType {
    a_float_input: Float = 9876543210
}
```

### Assume `Accept: application/json` when no `Accept` header is present [Issue #1990](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1990))

the `Accept` header means `*/*` when it is absent.

### Missing `@skip` and `@include` implementation for root operations ([Issue #2072](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2072))

`@skip` and `@include` were not implemented for inline fragments and fragment spreads on top level operations.

## üõ† Maintenance
## üìö Documentation

### Fix example `helm show values` command ([PR #2088](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2088))

The `helm show vaues` command needs to use the correct Helm chart reference `oci://ghcr.io/apollographql/helm-charts/router`.
