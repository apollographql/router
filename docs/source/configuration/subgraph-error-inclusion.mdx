title: Subgraph error inclusion
---

By default, the Apollo Router redacts the details of subgraph errors in its responses to clients. The router instead returns a default error with the following message:

```
Subgraph errors redacted
```

This redaction prevents potential leaks of sensitive information to the client. Using the `include_subgraph_errors` plugin, you can configure the router to propagate subgraph errors to clients instead. You can do this for all subgraphs, or on a per-subgraph basis.

## Configuration

To configure subgraph error inclusion, add the `include_subgraph_errors` plugin to your [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file), like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
include_subgraph_errors:
  all: true # Propagate errors from all subgraphs
  subgraphs:
    products: false # Do not propagate errors from the products subgraph
```

Any configuration under the `subgraphs` key takes precedence over configuration under the `all` key. In the example above, subgraph errors are included from all subgraphs _except_ the `products` subgraph.

## Sending errors to GraphOS
To report the subgraph errors to GraphOS that is a separate configuration that is not affected by client subgraph error inclusion, see the [GraphOS reporting docs](./telemetry/apollo-telemetry).

## Logging GraphQL request errors
To log the GraphQL error responses (i.e. messages returned in the GraphQL `errors` array) from the router, see the [logging configuration documentation](./telemetry/exporters/logging/overview).
