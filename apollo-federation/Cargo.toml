[features]
# This feature adds the `#[instrument]` macro to many function as well as
# logging statements that capture serialized versions of key data structures.
# This logging is gated behind a feature to avoid any unnecessary (even if
# small) runtime costs where this data will not be desired.
snapshot_tracing = ["ron"]
# `correctness` feature enables the `correctness` module.
