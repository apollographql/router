## üöÄ Features
### Line precise error reporting [PR #830](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/782)
The router will make a best effort to give line precise error reporting if the configuration was invalid.
```yaml
1. /telemetry/tracing/trace_config/sampler

telemetry:
  tracing:
    trace_config:
      service_name: router3
      sampler: "0.3"
               ^----- "0.3" is not valid under any of the given schemas
```
### Install experience [PR #820](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/820)

  Added an install script that will automatically download and unzip the router into the local directory.
  For more info see the quickstart documentation.

The telemetry plugin will now Drop cleanly when the Router service stack fails to build.

Extensions are now propagated following the configuration of the `include_subgraph_error` plugin.

Jaeger and Zipkin telemetry config produced JSON schema that was invalid.

### Early return a better error when introspection is disabled [PR #751](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/751)
Instead of returning an error coming from the query planner, we are now returning a proper error explaining that the introspection has been disabled.

If present in the query plan fetch noede, the operation name will be added to sub-fetches.

Router configuration files within the project are now largely validated via unit test.

### Switch web server framework from `warp` to `axum` [PR #751](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/751)
The router is now running by default with an [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/) web server instead of `warp`.
