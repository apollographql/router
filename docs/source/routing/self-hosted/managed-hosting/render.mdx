In this guide, you will deploy the GraphOS Router using the [Render](https://render.com/) template.

## Prerequisites

You will need:

- [A GraphQL API set up in GraphOS](/graphos/get-started/guides/graphql#step-1-set-up-your-graphql-api). You will need your graph credentials: `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`.
- A [Render account](https://render.com/)
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)

## Option 1: Quick deployment with template (Recommended)

The fastest way to deploy the Apollo Router on Render is using the official template:

1. Deploy using the template:
    <a href="https://render.com/deploy?repo=github.com/apollographql/router-template">
      <img src="https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg" alt="Deploy to Render" width="200px"/>
    </a>

1. Configure your service:
   - **Service Name**: Enter a name for your router service
   - **Branch**: Select `main` or your preferred branch

1. Set environment variables:
   - `APOLLO_KEY`: Your Graph API key from GraphOS Studio
   - `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`: Your graph reference, e.g. `my-graph@production`
   - `PORT`: Set to `4000`

1. Click **Create Web Service** to start the deployment.

1. After the deployment finishes, visit your service URL to confirm the router is running.

## Option 2: Custom deployment

If you need more control over your deployment, you can set up a custom deployment using the [Apollo Runtime container](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker).

After following the steps in the [Docker](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker) guide, you can deploy your router to Render using the following steps:

1. Create a `render.yaml` file for Render-specific configuration:

    ```yaml title="render.yaml"
    services:
      - type: web
        name: apollo-router
        runtime: docker
        plan: free  # or starter/standard based on your needs
        envVars:
          - key: APOLLO_GRAPH_REF
            sync: false  # Set this manually in Render dashboard
          - key: APOLLO_KEY
            sync: false  # Set this manually in Render dashboard
          - key: PORT
            value: "4000"
            sync: true
        region: oregon  # or your preferred region
        dockerContext: .
        dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
        rootDir: ./
    version: "1"
    ```

1. Connect your repository:
   - In your Render dashboard, click **New** > **Web Service**
   - Connect your GitHub repository containing the router configuration

1. Configure the service:
   - **Runtime**: Docker
   - **Build Command**: Leave empty (Docker handles the build)
   - **Start Command**: Leave empty (defined in Dockerfile)

1. Set environment variables:
   - Add `APOLLO_KEY` and set it to your graph API key
   - Add `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` and set it to your graph reference
   - Add `PORT` and set it to `4000`

1. Click **Create Web Service**.
