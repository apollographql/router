title: Logging in the Apollo Router
---

import { Link } from 'gatsby';

The Apollo Router accepts a command-line argument to set its log level:

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `--log`

</td>
<td>

The log level, indicating the _most_ severe log message type to include. In ascending order of verbosity, can be one of: `off`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace`.

The default value is `info`.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

The router also accepts an `APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG` environment variable with the same possible values as the command-line argument. If you provide _both_, the command-line argument takes precedence.

## Output formats

The Apollo Router supports two logging formats:

* [Basic logging](#basic-logging-via-shell), primarily for local development
* [JSON-formatted logging](#json-formatted-logging), for compatibility with searchable logging tools like Google Cloud Logging

The router uses basic logging whenever an interactive shell session is attached, and it uses JSON-formatted logging otherwise (e.g., in CI and deployed environments).

### Basic logging via shell

Basic logging is mostly used during local development:

```
2022-03-18T10:28:11.090054Z  INFO apollo_router::executable: apollo-router@0.1.0-alpha.9
2022-03-18T10:28:11.160650Z  INFO apollo_router: Starting Apollo Router
2022-03-18T10:28:11.339906Z  INFO apollo_router: Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4000 ðŸš€
```

### JSON-formatted logging

JSON-formatted logging provides compatibility with common searchable logging tools like Google Cloud Logging. The Apollo Router uses the popular Bunyan format:

```json
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:41.926942Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"apollo-router@0.1.0-alpha.9"},"target":"apollo_router::executable"}
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:41.985121Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Starting Apollo Router"},"target":"apollo_router"}
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:42.171173Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4000 ðŸš€"},"target":"apollo_router"}
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:43.453993Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Stopped"},"target":"apollo_router"}
```
