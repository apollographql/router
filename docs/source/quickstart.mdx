Hello! This tutorial walks you through installing the Apollo Router and running it in front of some Apollo-hosted example subgraphs.

> **This quickstart helps you run a _self-hosted_ instance of the Apollo Router.** If you [create a cloud supergraph](/graphos/quickstart/cloud/) with Apollo GraphOS, Apollo provisions and hosts your supergraph's router for you.
>
> Cloud supergraphs are recommended for organizations that don't need to host their router in their own infrastructure.

## 1. Download and extract the Apollo Router binary

<ElasticNotice />


### Download options


#### Automatic download (Linux, OSX, WSL)

If you have a bash-compatible terminal, you can download the latest version of the Apollo Router directly to your current directory with the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://router.apollo.dev/download/nix/latest | sh
```

#### Manual download

Go to the Apollo Router's [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases) and download the latest `.tar.gz` file that matches your system. Currently, tarballs are available for the following:

* Linux (x86_64)
* Linux (aarch64)
* macOS (Apple Silicon)
* Windows (x86_64)

If a tarball for your system or architecture isn't available, you can [build and run Apollo Router from source](https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/DEVELOPMENT.md#development-1).  You can also [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/new/choose) to request the addition of new architectures.

After downloading, extract the file by running the following from a new project directory, substituting the path to the tarball:

```bash
tar -xf path/to/file.tar.gz --strip-components=1
```

If you omit the `--strip-components=1` option, the `router` executable is installed in a `dist` subdirectory.

### Running the binary

You can now run the Apollo Router from your project's root directory with the following command:

```bash
./router
```

If you do, you'll get output similar to the following:

```
Apollo Router <version> // (c) Apollo Graph, Inc. // Licensed as ELv2 (https://go.apollo.dev/elv2)

‚ö†Ô∏è  The Apollo Router requires a composed supergraph schema at startup. ‚ö†Ô∏è

üëâ DO ONE:

  * Pass a local schema file with the '--supergraph' option:

      $ ./router --supergraph <file_path>

  * Fetch a registered schema from GraphOS by setting
    these environment variables:

      $ APOLLO_KEY="..." APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="..." ./router

      For details, see the Apollo docs:
      https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/setup

üî¨ TESTING THINGS OUT?

  1. Download an example supergraph schema with Apollo-hosted subgraphs:

    $ curl -L https://supergraph.demo.starstuff.dev/ > starstuff.graphql

  2. Run the Apollo Router in development mode with the supergraph schema:

    $ ./router --dev --supergraph starstuff.graphql
```

This is because Apollo Router requires a supergraph schema and we aren't providing it one! Let's fix that.

## 2. Download the example supergraph schema

For this quickstart, we're using example Apollo-hosted subgraphs, along with an example supergraph schema that's composed from those subgraph schemas.

From your project's root directory, run the following:

```bash
curl -sSL https://supergraph.demo.starstuff.dev/ > supergraph-schema.graphql
```

This saves a `supergraph-schema.graphql` file with the following contents:

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand">

```graphql title="supergraph-schema.graphql"

}

}

  @join__type(graph: REVIEWS, key: "id")

  author: User @join__field(graph: REVIEWS, provides: "username")
  body: String @join__field(graph: REVIEWS)
  id: ID! @join__field(graph: REVIEWS)

}

type User
  @join__owner(graph: ACCOUNTS)
  @join__type(graph: ACCOUNTS, key: "id")
  @join__type(graph: REVIEWS, key: "id")
{
  id: ID! @join__field(graph: ACCOUNTS)
  name: String @join__field(graph: ACCOUNTS)
  reviews: [Review] @join__field(graph: REVIEWS)
  username: String @join__field(graph: ACCOUNTS)
}
```

</ExpansionPanel>

This file is all that the router needs to communicate with our subgraphs!

## 3. Run the router in development mode with the default configuration

Now from your project root, run the following:

```sh
./router --dev --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
```

The console output should look like the following:

```sh
2022-06-29T22:23:24.266542Z  INFO apollo_router::executable: Apollo Router v0.9.5 // (c) Apollo Graph, Inc. // Licensed as ELv2 (https://go.apollo.dev/elv2)
2022-06-29T22:23:24.488286Z  INFO apollo_router::router: starting Apollo Router
2022-06-29T22:23:25.774334Z  INFO apollo_router::axum_http_server_factory: GraphQL endpoint exposed at http://127.0.0.1:4000/ üöÄ
```

That's it! Running the Router with the `--dev` flag enables a development mode that exposes [Apollo Sandbox](/graphos/explorer/sandbox/) so you can run queries against the Apollo Router.

<Caution>

**Do not use the `--dev` flag in a non-development environment.** It relaxes certain default configuration options to provide an improved local development experience (e.g., it exposes subgraph error messages to clients).

[Learn more about dev mode defaults.](./configuration/overview#dev-mode-defaults)

</Caution>

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000` to open Apollo Sandbox, inspect your entire supergraph, and run your first queries!

## Next steps

Now that you know how to run the Apollo Router with a supergraph schema, you can:

* Set up [managed federation](/federation/managed-federation/overview)
* Learn about [additional configuration options](./configuration/overview)
* [Estimate the system resources needed to deploy the router](/technotes/TN0045-router_resource_estimator/).
