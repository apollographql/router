> For installation instructions, see the [quickstart](../quickstart/).

You run Apollo Router with the following command (assuming you're in the same directory as the `router` executable):

```bash
./router --config configuration.yaml --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
```

Options are described below.

## Options

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>

<tbody>

<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `-s` / `--supergraph`

</td>
<td>

The absolute or relative path to the router's [supergraph schema](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/#federated-schemas).

To learn how to compose your supergraph schema with the Rover CLI, see the [Federation quickstart](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/quickstart/#3-compose-the-supergraph-schema).

**Required** unless you provide this value via the `SCHEMA_PATH` environment variable.

##### `-c` / `--config`

</td>
<td>

The absolute or relative path to the router's optional [YAML configuration file](#configuration-file).

You can also provide this value via the `CONFIGURATION_PATH` environment variable.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `--log`

</td>
<td>

Log level which may be one of: `off`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace`.

Default: `info`

</td>
</tr>

## Handling CORS

If you attempt to query Apollo Router from a browser-based client, your request might be rejected due to CORS policies.

You can configure CORS in the [YAML configuration file](#configuration-file) you can provide to Apollo Router.

Here's an example configuration for adding `localhost` to the list of approved origins:

```yaml
# examples/nodejs/configuration.yaml
server:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
  cors:
    origins:
      - https://studio.apollographql.com
      - http://localhost
```

## Logging

Apollo Router detects if the stdout is a TTY and enables JSON logging only if it is not.

## Configuration file

Apollo Router takes an optional YAML configuration file as input via the `--config` option. All supported configuration options are listed below:

```yaml:title=configuration.yaml
# Configuration of the router's HTTP server
server:
  # The socket address and port to listen on
  # Defaults to 127.0.0.1:4000
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000

  # Cross origin request headers
  cors:
    # Set to false to disallow any origin and rely exclusively on `origins`
    # Defaults to true
    allow_any_origin: true
    # List of accepted origins
    origins:
      - https://studio.apollographql.com
    # Set to true to add the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header
    allow_credentials: false
    # The headers to allow.
    # Defaults to the required request header for Apollo Studio: Content-Type
    allow_headers: [ Content-Type ]
    # Allowed request methods
    # Defaults to GET, POST, OPTIONS.
    methods: [ GET, POST, OPTIONS ]
    # Which response headers should be made available to scripts running in the browser,
    # in response to a cross-origin request.
    expose_headers:

# Names and URLs of all subgraphs
# By default, this information is parsed from the supergraph schema
# Provide it here to override subgraph names or URLs
subgraphs:
  # Defines a subgraph named "accounts"
  accounts:
    # The URL of the accounts subgraph's GraphQL endpoint
    routing_url: http://localhost:4001/graphql
  # Defines a second subgraph named "products"
  products:
    routing_url: http://localhost:4003/graphql

# OpenTelemetry configuration, see next section
# opentelemetry:
```

## Tracing

The Apollo Router supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), it has exporters for [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) and for the [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/components/otlp-exporter) over HTTP or gRPC.
It will generate a trace of the various phases of the GraphQL query and their dependencies.

It will send a `TraceParent` header to subgraphs so they can create and send their own spans under the same trace.
If the request to the Router already contains a `TraceParent` header, it will use its value as trace id instead of generating a random one.

### Using Jaeger

```yaml:title=configuration.yaml
server:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
opentelemetry:
  jaeger:
    # optional url of the jaeger collector
    collector_endpoint: "http://example.org"
    # name of the service used in traces
    # defaults to router
    service_name: "router"
    # the username and password are obtained from the environment variables
    # JAEGER_USERNAME and JAEGER_PASSWORD
    trace_config:
      # trace sampling, possible values are `AlwaysOn`, `AlwaysOff` or `TraceIdRatioBased: number`
      # the ratio sampler takes a value between 0 and 1 and decides at the trace creation if it will
      # be recorded or not
      sampler:
        TraceIdRatioBased: 0.42
      max_events_per_span: 1
      max_attributes_per_span: 2
      max_links_per_span: 3
      max_attributes_per_event: 4
      max_attributes_per_link: 5
      resource:
        attrs:
          key1:
            String: value
          key2:
            Bool: true
          key3:
            I64: 42
          key4:
            F64: 42.0
          key5:
            Array:
              String:
                - value1
                - value2
```

### Using OTLP


```yaml:title=configuration.yaml
server:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
opentelemetry:
  # Configuration to send traces and metrics to an OpenTelemetry Protocol compatible service
  otlp:
    tracing:
      exporter:
        # 'http' for OTLP/HTTP, 'grpc' for OTLP/gRPC
        http:
          # URL of the exporter
          endpoint:
          # Possible options: 'Grpc' for GRPC protocol and 'HttpBinary' for HTTP protocol with binary protobuf
          protocol: Grpc
          # timmeout in seconds
          timeout: 60
          metadata:
            - foo: bar
      trace_config:
        # trace sampling, possible values are `AlwaysOn`, `AlwaysOff` or `TraceIdRatioBased: number`
        # the ratio sampler takes a value between 0 and 1 and decides at the trace creation if it will
        # be recorded or not
        sampler:
          TraceIdRatioBased: 0.42
        max_events_per_span: 1
        max_attributes_per_span: 2
        max_links_per_span: 3
        max_attributes_per_event: 4
        max_attributes_per_link: 5
        resource:
          attrs:
            key1:
              String: value
            key2:
              Bool: true
            key3:
              I64: 42
            key4:
              F64: 42.0
            key5:
              Array:
                String:
                  - value1
                  - value2
```
