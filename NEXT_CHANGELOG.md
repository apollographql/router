## 🐛 Fixes

### Do not erase errors when missing `_entities` ([Issue #1863](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1863))

in a federated query, if the subgraph returned a response with errors and a null or absent data field, the router
was ignoring the subgraph error and instead returning an error complaining about the missing` _entities` field.
This will now aggregate the subgraph error and the missing `_entities` error.

### Move response formatting to the execution service ([Issue #1771](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1771))

The response formatting process, where response data is filtered according to deferred responses subselections
and the API schema, was executed in the supergraph service. This is a bit late, because it results in the
execution service returning a stream of invalid responses, so the execution plugins work on invalid data.
