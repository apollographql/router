> ⚠️ Apollo Router support for traffic shaping is currently experimental.

The Apollo Router provides experimental support for traffic shaping.

Currently features are limited, but are expected to grow over time:

- **Sub-query deduplication** - Identical, in-flight, non-mutation sub-queries are compressed into a single request.
- **Variables deduplication** - Subgraph requests body is compressed to deduplicate variables.

## Configuration

To configure traffic shaping add the `traffic_shaping` plugin to `your router.yaml`:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
plugins:
  experimental.traffic_shaping:
    variables_deduplication: true # Enable the variables deduplication optimization
    all:
      query_deduplication: true # Enable query deduplication for all subgraphs.
    subgraphs:
      products:
        query_deduplication: false # Disable query deduplication for products.
```

Note that configuration in the `subgraphs` section will take precedence over that in the `all` section.

### Sub-query deduplication

Deduplication will cause any identical, in-flight, non-mutation sub-queries to be merged into a single request. This can reduce network bandwidth and CPU at your subgraph.

Note that only in flight requests are deduplicated.

### Variables deduplication

Variables deduplication will cause any identical variables in the sub-request body to be merged into an unique list of variables. This can reduce network bandwidth and CPU at your subgraph.
