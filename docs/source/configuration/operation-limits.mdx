You can define **operation limits** in your router's configuration to reject potentially malicious requests. An operation that exceeds _any_ specified limit is rejected (unless you run your router in [`warn_only` mode](#warn_only-mode)).

## Setup

To use operation limits, you must run v1.17 or later of the GraphOS Router. [Download the latest version.](../quickstart#download-options)

You define operation limits in your router's [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file), like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
limits:
  max_depth: 100
  max_height: 200
  max_aliases: 30
  max_root_fields: 20

  # Uncomment to enable warn_only mode
  # warn_only: true
```

Each limit takes an integer value. You can define any combination of [supported limits](#supported-limits).

## Supported limits

### `max_depth`

Limits the deepest nesting of selection sets in an operation, including fields in fragments.

The `GetBook` operation below has depth three:

```graphql
query GetBook {
  book { # Depth 1 (root field)
    ...bookDetails
  }
}

fragment bookDetails on Book {
  details { # Depth 2 (nested under `book`)
    ... on ProductDetailsBook {
      country # Depth 3 (nested under `details`)
    }
  }
}
```

### `max_height`

Limits the number of unique fields included in an operation, including fields of fragments. If a particular field is included _multiple_ times via aliases, it's counted only _once_.

The `GetUser` operation below has height three:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user { # 1
    id   # 2
    name # 3
    username: name # Aliased duplicate (not counted)
  }
}
```

Each unique field increments an operation's height by one, regardless of that field's return type (scalar, object, or list). 

### `max_aliases`

Limits the total number of aliased fields in an operation, including fields of fragments.

The `GetUser` operation below includes three aliases:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user {
    nickname: name # 1
    username: name # 2
    handle: name   # 3
  }
}
```

Each aliased field increments the alias count by one, regardless of that field's return type (scalar, object, or list).

### `max_root_fields`

Limits the number of root fields in an operation, including root fields in fragments. If a particular root field is included _multiple_ times via aliases, _each usage_ is counted.

The following operation includes three root fields:

```graphql
query GetTopProducts {
  topBooks { # 1
    id
  }
  topMovies { # 2
    id
  }
  topGames { # 3
    id
  }
}
```

## `warn_only` mode

If you run your router in `warn_only` mode, operations that exceed defined limits are _not_ rejected. Instead, the router processes these operations as usual and emits a `WARN` trace that notes all exceeded limits, like so:

```
2023-03-15T19:08:23.123456Z WARN apollo_router::operation_limits: max_depth exceeded, max_depth: 3, current_op_depth: 5, operation: "query GetOwnerLocation {cat {owner {location {postalCode}}}}"
```

Running in `warn_only` mode can be useful while you're testing to determine the most appropriate limits to set for your supergraph.

You can enable or disable `warn_only` mode in your router's [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file), like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
limits:
  warn_only: true # warn_only mode always enabled
```

## Response format for exceeded limits

Whenever your router rejects a request because it exceeds an operation limit, the router responds with a 400 HTTP status code and a standard GraphQL error response body:

```json5
# HTTP 400
{
  "data": {},
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Maximum height (field count) limit exceeded in this operation",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "MAX_HEIGHT_LIMIT"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If you run your router in [`warn_only` mode](#warn_only-mode), the router logs the limit violation but executes the operation as normal, returning a 200 status code with the expected response.

## Using telemetry to set operation limits

Router telemetry can help you set operation limits, especially when you have a large number of existing operations. You can measure incoming operations over a fixed duration, then use the captured data as a baseline configuration.

### Logging values

To log limit information about every operation, you can configure the router with a [custom event](/router/configuration/telemetry/instrumentation/events#custom-events) to log the values of aliases, depth, height, and root_fields for each operation:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      supergraph:
        OPERATION_LIMIT_INFO:
          message: operation limit info
          on: response
          level: info
          attributes:
            graphql.operation.name: true
            query.aliases:
              query: aliases
            query.depth:
              query: depth
            query.height:
              query: height
            query.root_fields:
              query: root_fields
```

<Note>

For a large amount of traffic, you may prefer to collect and export metrics to your APM instead.

### Collecting metrics

To capture and view metrics to help set your operation limits, you can configure the router to collect [custom metrics](/router/configuration/telemetry/instrumentation/instruments#custom-instruments) on the values of aliases, depth, height, and root_fields for each operation:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    metrics:
      common:
        views:
          # Define a custom view because operation limits are different than the default latency-oriented view of OpenTelemetry
          - name: oplimits.*
            aggregation:
              histogram:
                buckets:
                  - 0
                  - 5
                  - 10
                  - 25
                  - 50
                  - 100
                  - 500
                  - 1000
  instrumentation:
    instruments:
      supergraph:
        oplimits.aliases:
          value:
            query: aliases
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Aliases for an operation"
        oplimits.depth:
          value:
            query: depth
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Depth for an operation"
        oplimits.height:
          value:
            query: height
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Height for an operation"
        oplimits.root_fields:
          value:
            query: root_fields
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Root fields for an operation"
```

You should also configure the router to [export metrics](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/metrics/overview) to your APM tool.
