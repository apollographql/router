# [0.12.1] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Remove the generic stream type from `RouterResponse` and `ExecutionResponse` ([PR #1420](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1420))

This generic type complicates the API with limited benefit because we use `BoxStream` everywhere in plugins:

* `RouterResponse<BoxStream<'static, Response>>` -> `RouterResponse`
* `ExecutionResponse<BoxStream<'static, Response>>` -> `ExecutionResponse`

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1420

### Remove the HTTP request from `QueryPlannerRequest` ([PR #1439](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1439))

The content of `QueryPlannerRequest` is used as argument to the query planner and as a cache key,
so it should not change depending on the variables or HTTP headers.

## üöÄ Features

### Experimental support for the `@defer` directive ([PR #1182](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1182))

The router can now understand the `@defer` directive, used to tag parts of a query so the response is split into
multiple parts that are sent one by one.

:warning: *this is still experimental and not fit for production use yet*

To activate it, add this option to the configuration file:

```yaml
server:
  experimental_defer_support: true
```

### Rewrite the caching API ([PR #1281](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1281))

This introduces a new asynchronous caching API that opens the way to multi level caching (in memory and
database). The API revolves around an `Entry` structure that allows query deduplication and lets the
client decide how to generate the value to cache, instead of a complicated delegate system inside the
cache.

## üêõ Fixes

### Update the scaffold template so it targets router v0.12.0 ([PR #1431](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1431))

The cargo scaffold template will target the latest version of the router.

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1248

### Selection merging on non-object field aliases ([PR #1406](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1406))

Fixed a bug where merging aliased fields would sometimes put `null`s instead of expected values. 

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1432

### A Rhai error instead of a Rust panic ([PR #1414 https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1414))

In Rhai plugins, accessors that mutate the originating request are not available when in the subgraph phase. Previously, trying to mutate anyway would cause a Rust panic. This has been changed to a Rhai error instead.

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1414

### Optimizations ([PR #1423](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1423))

* Do not clone the client request during query plan execution
* Do not clone the usage reporting
* Avoid path allocations when iterating over JSON values

The benchmarks show that this change brings a 23% gain in requests per second compared to the main branch.
