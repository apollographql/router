[workspace]
# Make this a separate workspace.
#
# If this package was in the same workspace as other examples
# which donâ€™t specify `default-features = false`, then apollo-router
# would be compiled with its default global-allocator feature
# and compilation of this example would fail.
#
# To manually test this example:
# cargo run --manifest-path examples/custom-global-allocator/Cargo.toml -- --help
