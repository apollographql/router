actions:

    path: subscription.mode.preview_callback
    log: "'subscription.mode.preview_callback' configuration does no longer exist, it's now in GA and should be 'subscription.mode.callback' instead. The 'public_url' configuration must also include the configured 'path'.\n\n The new stable version of callback protocol is not backward compatible with the experimental one.\n\n Please ensure to upgrade your subgraph implementation.
