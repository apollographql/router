### Adds references to enums in responses to the extended references report ([Issue #ROUTER-375](https://apollographql.atlassian.net/browse/ROUTER-375))

Updates the enhanced reference experimental feature so that we now also send references to enums from response objects in the reports. Also adds some metrics related to the functionality.
