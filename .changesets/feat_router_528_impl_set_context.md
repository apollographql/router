### Add `@context` support in the native query planner ([PR #6310](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6310))

The [`@context`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/directives#context) feature is now available in the native query planner.
This brings the native query planner to feature parity with the legacy query planner for all Federation v2 graphs.
