                Shared field "E.s" return type "U!" has a non-intersecting set of possible runtime types across subgraphs. Runtime types in subgraphs are:
                - in subgraph "A", types "A" and "B";
                - in subgraph "B", types "C" and "D".
                This is not allowed as shared fields must resolve the same way in all subgraphs, and that imply at least some common runtime types between the subgraphs.
