  # Authentication Mechanism
  # plugin name: example.jwt
  #
  # Mandatory Configuration:
  #   - algorithm: HS256 | HS384 | HS512
  #   - key: valid base64 encoded key
  #
  # Optional Configuration:
  #   - time_tolerance <u64>
  #   - max_token_life <u64>
  #
  # Both optional parameters are in units of seconds. Both default to 15 mins if
  # not specified.
  # time_tolerance: is how much time we are prepared to add on to expiration dates
  # max_token_life: is the time between issued and expires for a token
  #
  # For example: we want to use HS256 as our verification algorithm and we are
  # prepared to let tokens have an extra 60 seconds of life, but we won't
  # accept tokens that were issued with more than 10 minutes of life.
