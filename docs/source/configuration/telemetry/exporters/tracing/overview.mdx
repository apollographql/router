title: Router Tracing
subtitle: Collect tracing information from the Apollo Router
description: Collect and export tracing information from the Apollo Router. Supports OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), Datadog, New Relic, Jaeger, Zipkin.
---

The Apollo Router supports collection of traces with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), with exporters for:

* [Jaeger](./jaeger)
* [Zipkin](./zipkin)
* [Datadog](./datadog)
* [New Relic](./new-relic)
* [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](./otlp) over HTTP or gRPC

The Apollo Router generates [**spans**](../../instrumentation/spans) that include the various phases of serving a request and associated dependencies. This is useful for showing how response time is affected by:

* Sub-request response times
* Query shape (sub-request dependencies)
* Apollo Router post-processing

Span data is sent to a collector such as [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), which can assemble spans into a gantt chart for analysis.

<Tip>

To get the most out of distributed tracing, _all_ components in your system should be instrumented.

## Tracing common configuration

Common tracing configuration contains global settings for all exporters.

### Service name

Set a service name for your router traces so you can easily locate them in external metrics dashboards.

The service name can be set by an environment variable or in [`router.yaml`](../../../overview#yaml-config-file), with the following order of precedence (first to last):

1. `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable
2. `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable
3. `telemetry.exporters.tracing.common.service_name` in `router.yaml`

      <ExpansionPanel title="Example service_name">

      Example setting service name in `telemetry.exporters.tracing.common.service_name`:

      ```yaml title="router.yaml"
      telemetry:
        exporters:
          tracing:
            common:
              # (Optional) Set the service name to easily find metrics related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
              service_name: "router" #highlight-line
      ```

      </ExpansionPanel>


4. `telemetry.exporters.tracing.common.resource` in `router.yaml`

      <ExpansionPanel title="Example resource">

      Example setting service name in `telemetry.exporters.tracing.common.resource`:

      ```yaml title="router.yaml"
      telemetry:
        exporters:
           tracing:
             common:
               resource:
                 # (Optional) Set the service name to easily find metrics related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
                 "service.name": "router" #highlight-line
      ```

      </ExpansionPanel>

If the service name isn't explicitly set, it defaults to `unknown_service:router` or `unknown_service` if the executable name cannot be determined.

### `resource`

A resource attribute is a set of key-value pairs that provide additional information to an exporter. Application performance monitors (APM) may interpret and display resource information. 

In [`router.yaml`](../../../overview#yaml-config-file), resource attributes are set in `telemetry.exporters.tracing.common.resource`. For example:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
     tracing:
       common:
         resource:
           "environment.name": "production"
           "environment.namespace": "{env.MY_K8_NAMESPACE_ENV_VARIABLE}"
```

For OpenTelemetry conventions for resources, see [Resource Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/resource/README.md).

### `sampler`

You can configure the sampling rate of traces to match the rate of your application performance monitors (APM). To enable sampling configuration, in [`router.yaml`](../../../overview#yaml-config-file) set `telemetry.exporters.tracing.common.sampler` and `telemetry.exporters.tracing.common.parent_based_sampler`:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
     tracing:
       common:
         sampler: always_on # (default) all requests are sampled (always_on|always_off|<0.0-1.0>)
         parent_based_sampler: true # (default) If an incoming span has OpenTelemetry headers then the request will always be sampled. 
```

- `sampler` sets the sampling rate as a decimal percentage, `always_on`, or `always_off`. For example, setting `sampler: 0.1` samples 10% of your requests.

- `parent_based_sampler` enables clients to make the sampling decision. This guarantees that a trace that starts at a client will also have spans at the router. You may wish to disable it (setting `parent_based_sampler: false`) if your router is exposed directly to the internet.

### `propagation`

The `telemetry.exporters.tracing.propagation` section allows you to configure which propagators are active in addition to those automatically activated by using an exporter.

Specifying explicit propagation is generally only required if you're using an exporter that supports multiple trace ID formats, for example, OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, or OpenTracing compatible exporters.

For example: 

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
     tracing:
       propagation:
         # https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/
         baggage: false
   
         # https://www.datadoghq.com/
         datadog: false
   
         # https://www.jaegertracing.io/ (compliant with opentracing)
         jaeger: false
   
         # https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/
         trace_context: false
   
         # https://zipkin.io/ (compliant with opentracing)
         zipkin: false
   
         # https://aws.amazon.com/xray/ (compliant with opentracing)
         aws_xray: false
   
         # If you have your own way to generate a trace id and you want to pass it via a custom request header
         request:
           header_name: my-trace-id
```

### Limits

You may set limits on spans to prevent sending too much data to your APM. For example:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
     tracing:
       common:
         max_attributes_per_event: 128
         max_attributes_per_link: 128
         max_attributes_per_span: 128
         max_events_per_span: 128
         max_links_per_span: 128
```

Attributes, events and links that exceed the limits are dropped silently.

#### `max_attributes_per_event` 

Events are used to describe something that happened in the context of a span. For example, an exception or a message sent. These events can have attributes that are key-value pairs that provide additional information to display via APM. 

#### `max_attributes_per_link`

Spans may link to other spans in the same or different trace. For example, a span may link to a parent span, or a span may link to a span in a different trace to represent that trace's parent. These links may have attributes that are key-value pairs that provide additional information to display via APM.

#### `max_attributes_per_span`

Spans are used to a activity in the context of a trace. For example, a request to a subgraph or a query planning. Spans can have attributes that are key-value pairs that provide additional information to display via APM.

#### `max_events_per_span`

Spans may have events that describe something that happened in the context of a span. For example, an exception or a message sent. The number of events per span can be limited to prevent spans becoming very large.

#### `max_links_per_span`

Spans may link to other spans in the same or different trace. For example, a span may link to a parent span, or a span may link to a span in a different trace to represent that trace's parent. The number of links per span can be limited to prevent spans becoming very large.

### `experimental_response_trace_id`

<ExperimentalFeature appendText="You can also give feedback in the [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/2147)." />

If you want to expose in response headers the generated trace ID or the one you provided using propagation headers you can use this configuration:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
     tracing:
       experimental_response_trace_id:
         enabled: true # default: false
         header_name: "my-trace-id" # default: "apollo-trace-id"
```
Using this configuration you will have a response header called `my-trace-id` containing the trace ID. It could help you to debug a specific query if you want to grep your log with this trace id to have more context.

#### `experimental_response_trace_id` reference

| Attribute      | Default           | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`      | `false`           | Set to true to return trace IDs on response headers.  |
