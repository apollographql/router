subtitle: Protect your router from requests exceeding network, parser, and operation-based limits 
redirectFrom:

For enhanced security, the GraphOS Router can reject requests that violate any of the following kinds of limits:

- Operation-based semantic limits
- Network-based limits
- Parser-based lexical limits

```yaml title="router.yaml"
limits:
  # Network-based limits
  http_max_request_bytes: 2000000 # Default value: 2 MB
  http1_max_request_headers: 200 # Default value: 100
  http1_max_request_buf_size: 800kb # Default value: 400kib

  # Parser-based limits
  parser_max_tokens: 15000 # Default value
  parser_max_recursion: 500 # Default value

  # Operation-based limits (Enterprise only)
  max_depth: 100
  max_height: 200
  max_aliases: 30
  max_root_fields: 20
```

## Operation-based limits

<EnterpriseFeature linkWithAnchor="https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#graphos-router" />

You can define **operation limits** in your router's configuration to reject potentially malicious requests. An operation that exceeds _any_ specified limit is rejected (unless you run your router in [`warn_only` mode](#warn_only-mode)).

### Setup

To use operation limits, you must run v1.17 or later of the Apollo Router. [Download the latest version.](/graphos/reference/router/self-hosted-install/#download-options)

You define operation limits in your router's [YAML config file](/graphos/reference/router/configuration#yaml-config-file), like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
limits:
  max_depth: 100
  max_height: 200
  max_aliases: 30
  max_root_fields: 20

  # Uncomment to enable warn_only mode
  # warn_only: true
```

Each limit takes an integer value. You can define any combination of [supported limits](#supported-limits).

### Supported limits

#### `max_depth`

Limits the deepest nesting of selection sets in an operation, including fields in fragments.

The `GetBook` operation below has depth three:

```graphql
query GetBook {
  book { # Depth 1 (root field)
    ...bookDetails
  }
}

fragment bookDetails on Book {
  details { # Depth 2 (nested under `book`)
    ... on ProductDetailsBook {
      country # Depth 3 (nested under `details`)
    }
  }
}
```

#### `max_height`

Limits the number of unique fields included in an operation, including fields of fragments. If a particular field is included _multiple_ times via aliases, it's counted only _once_.

The `GetUser` operation below has height three:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user { # 1
    id   # 2
    name # 3
    username: name # Aliased duplicate (not counted)
  }
}
```

Each unique field increments an operation's height by one, regardless of that field's return type (scalar, object, or list). 

#### `max_aliases`

Limits the total number of aliased fields in an operation, including fields of fragments.

The `GetUser` operation below includes three aliases:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user {
    nickname: name # 1
    username: name # 2
    handle: name   # 3
  }
}
```

Each aliased field increments the alias count by one, regardless of that field's return type (scalar, object, or list).

#### `max_root_fields`

Limits the number of root fields in an operation, including root fields in fragments. If a particular root field is included _multiple_ times via aliases, _each usage_ is counted.

The following operation includes three root fields:

```graphql
query GetTopProducts {
  topBooks { # 1
    id
  }
  topMovies { # 2
    id
  }
  topGames { # 3
    id
  }
}
```

### `warn_only` mode

If you run your router in `warn_only` mode, operations that exceed defined limits are _not_ rejected. Instead, the router processes these operations as usual and emits a `WARN` trace that notes all exceeded limits, like so:

```
2023-03-15T19:08:23.123456Z WARN apollo_router::operation_limits: max_depth exceeded, max_depth: 3, current_op_depth: 5, operation: "query GetOwnerLocation {cat {owner {location {postalCode}}}}"
```

Running in `warn_only` mode can be useful while you're testing to determine the most appropriate limits to set for your supergraph.

You can enable or disable `warn_only` mode in your router's [YAML config file](/graphos/reference/router/configuration#yaml-config-file), like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
limits:
  warn_only: true # warn_only mode always enabled
```

### Response format for exceeded limits

Whenever your router rejects a request because it exceeds an operation limit, the router responds with a 400 HTTP status code and a standard GraphQL error response body:

```json5
# HTTP 400
{
  "data": {},
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Maximum height (field count) limit exceeded in this operation",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "MAX_HEIGHT_LIMIT"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If you run your router in [`warn_only` mode](#warn_only-mode), the router logs the limit violation but executes the operation as normal, returning a 200 status code with the expected response.

### Using telemetry to set operation-based limits

Router telemetry can help you set operation limits, especially when you have a large number of existing operations. You can measure incoming operations over a fixed duration, then use the captured data as a baseline configuration.

#### Logging values

To log limit information about every operation, you can configure the router with a [custom event](/graphos/reference/router/telemetry/instrumentation/events#custom-events) to log the values of aliases, depth, height, and root_fields for each operation:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      supergraph:
        OPERATION_LIMIT_INFO:
          message: operation limit info
          on: response
          level: info
          attributes:
            graphql.operation.name: true
            query.aliases:
              query: aliases
            query.depth:
              query: depth
            query.height:
              query: height
            query.root_fields:
              query: root_fields
```

<Note>

For a large amount of traffic, you may prefer to collect and export metrics to your APM instead.

</Note>

#### Collecting metrics

To capture and view metrics to help set your operation limits, you can configure the router to collect [custom metrics](/graphos/reference/router/telemetry/instrumentation/instruments#custom-instruments) on the values of aliases, depth, height, and root_fields for each operation:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    metrics:
      common:
        views:
          # Define a custom view because operation limits are different than the default latency-oriented view of OpenTelemetry
          - name: oplimits.*
            aggregation:
              histogram:
                buckets:
                  - 0
                  - 5
                  - 10
                  - 25
                  - 50
                  - 100
                  - 500
                  - 1000
  instrumentation:
    instruments:
      supergraph:
        oplimits.aliases:
          value:
            query: aliases
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Aliases for an operation"
        oplimits.depth:
          value:
            query: depth
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Depth for an operation"
        oplimits.height:
          value:
            query: height
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Height for an operation"
        oplimits.root_fields:
          value:
            query: root_fields
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Root fields for an operation"
```
You should also configure the router to [export metrics](/graphos/reference/router/telemetry/metrics-exporters/overview) to your APM tool.

## Network-based limits

### `http_max_request_bytes`

Limits the amount of data read from the network for the body of HTTP requests,
to protect against unbounded memory consumption.
This limit is checked before JSON parsing.
Both the GraphQL document and associated variables count toward it.

The default value is `2000000` bytes, 2 MB.

Before increasing this limit significantly consider testing performance
in an environment similar to your production, especially if some clients are untrusted.
Many concurrent large requests could cause the router to run out of memory.

### `http1_max_request_headers`

Limit the maximum number of headers of incoming HTTP1 requests.
The default value is 100 headers.

If router receives more headers than the buffer size, it responds to the client with `431 Request Header Fields Too Large`.

### `http1_max_request_buf_size`

Limit the maximum buffer size for the HTTP1 connection. Default is ~400kib.

Note for Rust Crate Users: If you are using the Router as a Rust crate, the `http1_request_max_buf_size` option requires the `experimental_hyper_header_limits` feature and also necessitates using Apollo's fork of the Hyper crate until the [changes are merged upstream](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/3523).
You can include this fork by adding the following patch to your Cargo.toml file:
```toml
[patch.crates-io]
"hyper" = { git = "https://github.com/apollographql/hyper.git", tag = "header-customizations-20241108" }
```

## Parser-based limits

### `parser_max_tokens`

Limits the number of tokens a query document can include. This counts _all_ tokens, including both [lexical and ignored tokens](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Language.Source-Text.Lexical-Tokens).

The default value is `15000`.

### `parser_max_recursion`

Limits the deepest level of recursion allowed by the router's GraphQL parser to prevent stack overflows. This corresponds to the deepest nesting level of any single GraphQL operation or fragment defined in a query document.

The default value is `500`.

In the example below, the `GetProducts` operation has a recursion of three, and the `ProductVariation` fragment has a recursion of two. Therefore, the _max_ recursion of the query document is three.

```graphql
query GetProducts {
  allProducts { #1
    ...productVariation
    delivery { #2
      fastestDelivery #3
    }
  }
}

fragment ProductVariation on Product {
  variation { #1
    name #2
  }
}
```

Note that the router calculates the recursion depth for each operation and fragment _separately_.  Even if a fragment is included in an operation, that fragment's recursion depth does not contribute to the _operation's_ recursion depth.

<Note>

In versions of the Apollo Router prior to 1.17, this limit was defined via the config option `experimental_parser_recursion_limit`.
