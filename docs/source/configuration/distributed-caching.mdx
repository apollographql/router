<EnterpriseFeature linkWithAnchor="https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#graphos-router" />

If you have multiple Apollo Router instances, those instances can share a Redis-backed cache for their query plans and automatic persisted queries (APQ). This means that if _any_ of your router instances caches a particular value, _all_ of your instances can look up that value to significantly improve responsiveness. For more details on query plans and APQ, see the article on [in-memory caching](./in-memory-caching).

## Prerequisites

To use this feature:

- You must have a Redis cluster (or single instance) that your router instances can communicate with.
- You must have a [GraphOS Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/) and [connect your router to GraphOS](./overview/#environment-variables).

## How it works

Whenever a router instance requires a query plan or APQ query string to resolve a client operation:

1. The router instance checks its own [in-memory cache](#in-memory-caching) for the required value and uses it if found.
2. If _not_ found, the router instance then checks the distributed Redis cache for the required value and uses it if found. It also then replicates the found value in its own in-memory cache.
3. If _not_ found, the router instance _generates_ the required query plan or requests the full operation string from the client for APQ.
4. The router instance stores the obtained value in both the distributed cache _and_ its in-memory cache. 

## Redis URL configuration

The distributed caching configuration must contain one or more URLs using different schemes depending on the expected deployment:

* `redis` - TCP connected to a centralized server.
* `rediss` - TLS connected to a centralized server.
* `redis-cluster` - TCP connected to a cluster.
* `rediss-cluster` - TLS connected to a cluster.
* `redis-sentinel` - TCP connected to a centralized server behind a sentinel layer.
* `rediss-sentinel` - TLS connected to a centralized server behind a sentinel layer.

The URLs must have the following format:

### One node

```
redis|rediss :// [[username:]password@] host [:port][/database]
```

Example: `redis://localhost:6379`

### Clustered

```
redis|rediss[-cluster] :// [[username:]password@] host [:port][?[node=host1:port1][&node=host2:port2][&node=hostN:portN]]
```

or, if configured with multiple URLs:

```
[
  "redis|rediss[-cluster] :// [[username:]password@] host [:port]",
  "redis|rediss[-cluster] :// [[username:]password@] host1 [:port1]",
  "redis|rediss[-cluster] :// [[username:]password@] host2 [:port2]"
]
```

### Sentinel

```
redis|rediss[-sentinel] :// [[username1:]password1@] host [:port][/database][?[node=host1:port1][&node=host2:port2][&node=hostN:portN]
                            [&sentinelServiceName=myservice][&sentinelUsername=username2][&sentinelPassword=password2]]
```

or, if configured with multiple URLs:

```
[
  "redis|rediss[-sentinel] :// [[username:]password@] host [:port][/database][?[&sentinelServiceName=myservice][&sentinelUsername=username2][&sentinelPassword=password2]]",
  "redis|rediss[-sentinel] :// [[username1:]password1@] host [:port][/database][?[&sentinelServiceName=myservice][&sentinelUsername=username2][&sentinelPassword=password2]]"
]
```

## Router configuration

<Tip>

In your router's YAML config file, **you should specify your Redis URLs via environment variables and [variable expansion](./overview#variable-expansion)**. This prevents your Redis URLs from being committed to version control, which is especially dangerous if they include authentication information like a username and/or password.

</Tip>

### Distributed query plan caching

To enable distributed caching of query plans, add the following to your router's [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file):

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
  query_planning:
    cache:
      redis: #highlight-line
        urls: ["redis://..."] #highlight-line
```

The value of `urls` is a list of URLs for all Redis instances in your cluster.

All query plan cache entries will be prefixed with `plan.` within the distributed cache. 

### Distributed APQ caching

To enable distributed caching of automatic persisted queries (APQ), add the following to your router's [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file):

```yaml title="router.yaml"
apq:
  router:
    cache:
      redis: #highlight-line
        urls: ["redis://..."] #highlight-line
```

The value of `urls` is a list of URLs for all Redis instances in your cluster.

All APQ cache entries will be prefixed with `apq` followed by a null byte character (referenced by the escape sequence `\0` in most programming languages) within the distributed cache.

### Common Redis configuration

Redis configuration is done in the same way for APQ caching, query plan caching and [entity caching](./entity-caching).

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
  query_planning:
    cache:
      redis: #highlight-line
        urls: ["redis://..."] #highlight-line
        username: admin/123 # Optional, can be part of the urls directly, mainly useful if you have special character like '/' in your password that doesn't work in url. This field takes precedence over the username in the URL
        password: admin # Optional, can be part of the urls directly, mainly useful if you have special character like '/' in your password that doesn't work in url. This field takes precedence over the password in the URL
        timeout: 5ms # Optional, by default: 2ms
        ttl: 24h # Optional
        namespace: "prefix"  # Optional
        #tls:
        required_to_start: false # Optional, defaults to false
        reset_ttl: true # Optional, defaults to true
```

#### Timeout

Connecting and sending commands to Redis are subject to a timeout, set by default to 2ms, that can be overriden.


#### TTL

The `ttl` option defines the default global expiration for Redis entries. For APQ caching, the default is no expiration, while for query plan caching, the default expiration is set to 30 days.

### Namespace

When using the same Redis instance for multiple puposes, the `namespace` option defines a prefix for all the keys defined by the router.

### TLS

<RedisTLS />

### Required to start

When active, the `required_to_start` option will prevent the Router from starting if it cannot connect to Redis. By default, the Router will still start without a connection to Redis, which would result in only using the in-memory cache for APQ and query planning, and entity caching sending the requests to subgraphs undisturbed.

### Reset TTL

When this option is active, accessing a cache entry in Redis will reset its expiration.
