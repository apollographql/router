You can create **customizations** for the GraphOS Router or Apollo Router Core to add functionality that isn't available via built-in [configuration options](/router/configuration/overview/). For example, you can make an external call to fetch authentication data for each incoming request.

## Customization types

The GraphOS Router supports the following customization types:

- [**Rhai scripts**](/graphos/routing/customization/rhai/)
  - The [Rhai scripting language](https://rhai.rs/book/) lets you add functionality directly to your stock router binary by hooking into different phases of the router's request lifecycle.
- [**External co-processing**](/router/customizations/coprocessor/) ([Licensed feature](/router/enterprise-features/))
  - If your organization has a [GraphOS plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/), you can write custom request-handling code in any language. This code can run in the same container as your router or separately.
  - The router calls your custom code via HTTP, passing it the details of each incoming client request.

The Apollo Router Core supports customization only through [Rhai scripts](/graphos/routing/customization/rhai/).

Because [Rhai scripts](/graphos/routing/customization/rhai/) are easier to deploy, we recommend using them if they support your use case. Use external co-processing if your customization needs to do any of the following (which Rhai scripts _don't_ support):

- Read or write to disk
- Make network requests
- Use libraries from a particular language or framework

## Customizations along the request lifecycle

Customizations intervene at specific points of the [request lifecycle](/graphos/routing/request-lifecycle), depending on the task you want to perform. Each point is represented by a specific service with its own request and response objects.

<RequestLifecycleOverviewDiagram />

<Tip>

Understand the entire request lifecycle by following flowcharts of its [request path](/graphos/routing/request-lifecycle#request-path) and [response path](/graphos/routing/request-lifecycle#response-path), starting from a client request to your subgraphs, and all the way back from subgraph responses to a client response.

</Tip>

### Request lifecycle plugins

Each service can have a set of plugins. For requests, the router executes plugins _before_ the service.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Service
    Plugin1["Plugin 1"] -->|request| Plugin2["Plugin 2"] -->|request| coreService["Core <br/>service"]
    coreService
  end

Client -->|request| Plugin1
coreService -->|request| NextService["Next service"]
```

For responses, the router executes the plugins _after_ the service.

```mermaid
flowchart RL
  subgraph Service
    coreService["Core <br/>service"] -->|response| Plugin2["Plugin 2"]  -->|response| Plugin1["Plugin 1"]
  end

Plugin1["Plugin 1"] -->|response| Client
NextService["Next service"] -->|response| coreService
```

Each request and response object contains a `Context` object, which is carried throughout the entire process. Each request's `Context` object is unique. You can use it to store plugin-specific information between the request and response or to communicate between different hook points. (A plugin can be called at multiple steps of the request lifecycle.)

### Request and response buffering

<Note>

This guidance applies if you are:
 - Modifying the router
 - Creating a native Rust plugin
 - Creating a custom binary

</Note>

The router expects to execute on a stream of data. In order to work correctly and provide high performance, the following expectations must be met:

* **Request Path**: No buffering before the end of the `router_service` processing step
* **Response Path**: No buffering

<Tip>

In general, it's best to avoid buffering where possible. If necessary, it is ok to do so on the request path once the `router_service` step is complete.

</Tip>


### Request Context

The router makes several values available in the request context, which is shared across stages of the processing pipeline.

- `apollo::apq::cache_hit`: present if the request used APQ, true if we got a cache hit for the query id, false otherwise
- `apollo::apq::registered`: true if the request registered a query in APQ
- `apollo::authentication::jwt_claims`: claims extracted from a JWT if present in the request
- `apollo::authorization::authenticated_required`: true if the query covers type of fields marked with `@authenticated`
- `apollo::authorization::required_policies`: if the query covers type of fields marked with `@policy`, it contains a map of `policy name -> Option<bool>`. A coprocessor or rhai script can edit this map to mark `true` on authorization policies that succeed or `false` on ones that fail
- `apollo::authorization::required_scopes`: if the query covers type of fields marked with `@requiresScopes`, it contains the list of scopes used by those directive applications
- `apollo::demand_control::actual_cost`: calculated cost of the responses returned by the subgraphs; populated by the demand control plugin
- `apollo::demand_control::estimated_cost`: estimated cost of the requests to be sent to the subgraphs; populated by the demand control plugin
- `apollo::demand_control::result`: `COST_OK` if allowed, and `COST_TOO_EXPENSIVE` if rejected due to cost limits; populated by the demand control plugin
- `apollo::demand_control::strategy`: the name of the cost calculation strategy used by the demand control plugin
- `apollo::entity_cache::cached_keys_status`: a map of cache control statuses for cached entities, keyed by subgraph request id; populated by the entity caching plugin when `expose_keys_in_context` is turned on in the router configuration
- `apollo::expose_query_plan::enabled`: true if experimental query plan exposure is enabled
- `apollo::expose_query_plan::formatted_plan`: query plan formatted as text
- `apollo::expose_query_plan::plan`: contains the query plan serialized as JSON (editing it has no effect on execution)
- `apollo::progressive_override::labels_to_override`: used in progressive override, list of labels for which we need an override
- `apollo::progressive_override::unresolved_labels`: used in progressive override, contains the list of unresolved labels
- `apollo::supergraph::first_event`: false if the current response chunk is not the first response in the stream, nonexistent otherwise
- `apollo::supergraph::operation_id`: contains the usage reporting stats report key
- `apollo::supergraph::operation_kind`: can be `query`, `mutation` or `subscription`
- `apollo::supergraph::operation_name`: name of the operation being executed (according to the query and the `operation_name` field in the request)
- `apollo::telemetry::client_name`: client name extracted from the client name header
- `apollo::telemetry::client_version`: client version extracted from the client version header
- `apollo::telemetry::contains_graphql_error`: true if the response contains at least one error
- `apollo::telemetry::studio_exclude`: true if the current request's trace details should be excluded from Studio
- `apollo::telemetry::subgraph_ftv1`: JSON-serialized trace data returned by the subgraph when FTV1 is enabled

## Creating customizations

To learn how to hook into the various lifecycle stages, including examples customizations, refer to the [Rhai scripts](/graphos/routing/customization/rhai/) and [external coprocessing](/router/customizations/coprocessor/) docs.
