# [x.x.x] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd
## ❗ BREAKING ❗
## 🚀 Features

### Add configuration for trace ID ([Issue #2080](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2080))

If you want to expose in response headers the generated trace ID or the one you provided using propagation headers you can use this configuration:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    experimental_response_trace_id:
      enabled: true # default: false
      header_name: "my-trace-id" # default: "apollo-trace-id"
    propagation:
      from_request_header: "x-request-id" # Specify your own trace_id with a custom header in request headers
```

Using this configuration you will have a response header called `my-trace-id` containing the trace ID. It could help you to debug a specific query if you want to grep your log with this trace id to have more context.

### Add a supergraph configmap option to the helm chart ([PR #2119](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2119))

Adds the capability to create a configmap containing your supergraph schema. Here's an example of how you could make use of this from your values.yaml and with the `helm` install command.

```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: APOLLO_ROUTER_SUPERGRAPH_PATH
    value: /data/supergraph-schema.graphql

extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: supergraph-schema
    mountPath: /data
    readOnly: true

extraVolumes:
  - name: supergraph-schema
    configMap:
      name: "{{ .Release.Name }}-supergraph"
      items:
        - key: supergraph-schema.graphql
          path: supergraph-schema.graphql
```

With that values.yaml content, and with your supergraph schema in a file name supergraph-schema.graphql, you can execute:

```
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --namespace router-test --set-file supergraphFile=supergraph-schema.graphql router-test oci://ghcr.io/apollographql/helm-charts/router --version 1.0.0-rc.9 --values values.yaml
```

## 🐛 Fixes

### Improve errors when subgraph returns non-GraphQL response with a non-2xx status code ([Issue #2117](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2117))

The error response will now contain the status code and status name. Example: `HTTP fetch failed from 'my-service': 401 Unauthorized`

## 🛠 Maintenance
## 📚 Documentation

### update documentation to reflect new examples structure ([Issue #2095](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2133))

We recently updated the examples directory structure. This fixes the documentation links to the examples. It also makes clear that rhai subgraph fields are read-only, since they are shared resources.
