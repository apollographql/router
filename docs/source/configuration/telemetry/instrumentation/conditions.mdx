You can set conditions for when an [instrument](./instruments) should be mutated or an [event](./events) should be triggered.


## Condition configuration
Here is an example of a condition on a custom instrument:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    instruments:
      router:
        my.instrument:
          value: duration
          type: counter
          unit: s
          description: "my description"
          # ...
          # This instrument will only be mutated if the condition evaluates to true
          condition:
            all:
              - any:
                  - eq:
                      - "val"
                      - request_header: x-req-header
              - eq:
                  - "foo"
                  - response_header: x-resp-header
```

#### `exists`

The `exists` condition is testing if [selectors](./selectors) is present.

For example, the following condition checks the value of `x-req-header` exists:

```yaml
exists:
  - request_header: x-req-header
```

#### `eq`

The `eq` condition is an equality test between [selectors](./selectors) or values.

For example, the following condition checks the value of `x-req-header` is equal to `val`:

```yaml
eq:
  - "val"
  - request_header: x-req-header
```

You can use selectors on both sides of the equality test:

```yaml
eq:
  - request_header: x-req-header1
  - request_header: x-req-header2
```

Values may be of types `string`, `number` or `boolean`.

#### `not`

The `not` condition is a negation of the nested condition.

For example, the following condition checks the value of `x-req-header` is _not_ equal to `val1`:

```yaml
not:
  eq:
    - "val1"
    - request_header: x-req-header2
```

#### `all`

The `all` condition is a list of conditions that all must be true in order for the condition to be true.

For example, the following `all` condition has a list of `eq` conditions that check the values of `x-req-header1` and `x-req-header2`, and both `eq` conditions must be true in order for the `all` condition to be true:

```yaml
all:
  - eq:
      - "val1"
      - request_header: x-req-header1
  - eq:
      - "val2"
      - request_header: x-req-header2
```

#### `any`

The `any` condition is a list of conditions of which at least one must be true for the condition to be true.

For example, the following `any` condition has a list of `eq` conditions that check the values of `x-req-header1` and `x-req-header2`, and at least one of the `eq` conditions must be true in order for the `all` condition to be true:

```yaml
any:
  - eq:
      - "val2"
      - request_header: x-req-header1
  - eq:
      - "val2"
      - request_header: x-req-header2
```

### Condition configuration reference

The available basic conditions:

| Condition | Description                                             |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `eq`     | An equality test between selectors or values             |
| `exist`  | A check to see if the selectors value exists             |
| `not`    | A negated equality test between selectors or values      |
| `all`    | A list of conditions that must all be true               |
| `any`    | A list of conditions of which at least one must be true  |

You can create complex conditions by using these basic conditions as building blocks.
