GraphQL subscriptions enable clients to manage real-time data updates effectively, without the need for constant polling.  This is particularly crucial in applications that need live updates, such as notifications, stock tickers, or chat applications. Using subscriptions improves performance and user experience by ensuring that clients receive the latest information as soon as changes occur on the backend. 

```graphql title="Example GraphQL subscription" showLineNumbers=false 
subscription OnStockPricesChanged {
  stockPricesChanged {
    symbol
    price
  }
}
```

The router supports both the callback and multipart protocols for handling subscriptions. With subscription support enabled, you can add `Subscription` fields to the schema of any subgraph that supports common WebSocket protocols for subscription communication:

```graphql title="stocks.graphql" showLineNumbers=false
type Subscription {
  stockPricesChanged: [Stock!]!
}
```
