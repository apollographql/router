## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó
## üöÄ Features

### Add support of dynamic header injection ([Issue #1755](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1755))

+ Insert static header

```yaml
headers:
  all: # Header rules for all subgraphs
    request:
    - insert:
        name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router"
        value: "indeed"
```

+ Insert header from context

```yaml
headers:
  all: # Header rules for all subgraphs
    request:
    - insert:
        name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router-context"
        from_context: "my_key_in_context"
```

+ Insert header from request body

```yaml
headers:
  all: # Header rules for all subgraphs
    request:
    + insert:
        name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router-request-body"
        path: ".operationName" # It's a JSON path query to fetch the operation name from request body
        default: "UNKNOWN" # If no operationName has been specified
```

## üêõ Fixes

### update and validate configuration files ([Issue #1854](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1854))

Several of the dockerfiles in the router repository were out of date with respect to recent configuration changes. This fix extends our configuration testing range and updates the configuration files.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Disable Deno snapshotting on docs.rs

This works around [V8 linking errors](https://docs.rs/crate/apollo-router/1.0.0-rc.2/builds/633287).

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1847

### Add the Uplink schema to the repository, with a test checking that it is up to date.

Previously it was downloaded at compile-time, 
which would [fail](https://docs.rs/crate/lets-see-if-this-builds-on-docs-rs/0.0.1/builds/633305) 
in build environments without Internet access.
If an update is needed, the test failure prints a message with the command to run.
