Keep in mind that the amount of telemetry you add can impact your router's performance.

- Custom metrics, events, and attributes consume more processing resources than standard metrics. Adding too many (standard or custom) can slow your router down.
- Configurations such as `events.*.request|error|response` that produce output for all router lifecycle services should only be used for development or debugging, not for production.
