Learn how to upgrade your GraphOS Router deployment from version 1.x to 2.x.

<Note>

GraphOS Router 2.x is available as a [Developer Preview](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/router-release-lifecycle#developer-preview). The most recent version is **{products.router.version("connectors").version}**. This upgrade guide will be updated throughout the Developer Preview and will have additions after each release.

</Note>

## New configuration in GraphOS Router v2.0.0-preview.x

The router v2.x introduces some new features that can impact the configuration from v1.x.

### Apollo operation usage reporting via OTLP

The router supports reporting operation usage metrics to GraphOS via OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP).

Prior to version 1.49.0 of the router, all GraphOS reporting was performed using a [private tracing format](/graphos/metrics/sending-operation-metrics#reporting-format). In v1.49.0, we introduced support for using OTel to perform this reporting. In v1.x, this is controlled using the `experimental_otlp_tracing_sampler` flag, and it's off by default.

Now in v2.x, this flag is renamed to `otlp_tracing_sampler`, and it's enabled by default.

Learn more about configuring [usage reporting via OTLP](/router/configuration/telemetry/apollo-telemetry#usage-reporting-via-opentelemetry-protocol-otlp).

### Metrics reporting defaults

Default values of some GraphOS reporting metrics have been changed from v1.x to the following in v2.x:

- `telemetry.apollo.signature_normalization_algorithm` now defaults to `enhanced`. (In v1.x the default is `legacy`.)
- `telemetry.apollo.metrics_reference_mode` now defaults to `extended`. (In v1.x the default is `standard`.)

## Removed features in GraphOS Router v2.x

### Support for Scaffold

<!-- PR: https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6274 -->

In Router v1.x Scaffold could be used to generate boilerplate source code for a Rust Plugin which extended functionality in a custom Router. This facility has been removed.

Source code generated using Scaffold will continue to compile; so existing Rust plugins will be unaffected by this change.

### `--apollo-uplink-poll-interval`

<!-- PR: https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6268 -->

The router no longer uses the `--apollo-uplink-poll-interval` command-line argument, or the `APOLLO_UPLINK_POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable. It already did something unusual in v1.x: the configured interval would only be used for the very first poll, and not any subsequent polls.

### Hot reloading `--supergraph-urls`, `APOLLO_ROUTER_SUPERGRAPH_URLS`

<!-- PR: https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6567 -->

The `--supergraph-urls` command-line argument or the `APOLLO_ROUTER_SUPERGRAPH_URLS` environment variable no longer support hot reloading. In v1.x, if hot reloading was enabled, the router would repeatedly fetch the URLs on the interval specified by `--apollo-uplink-poll-interval`.

If hot reloading from a remote URL is desired, consider running a script to download the supergraph URL on an interval, and point the router to the downloaded file on the filesystem.

### `--schema`

The deprecated `--schema` command-line argument is removed. `router config schema` should be used to print the configuration supergraph instead.

### Busy timer for request processing duration
Request processing duration is already included as part of the spans sent by the
router, and there is no need for rust plugin, coprocessor and rhai plugin users
to track this information manually. As a result, the following methods and structs were removed from `context::Context`:

- `context::Context::busy_time()`
- `context::Context::enter_active_request()`
- `context::BusyTimer` struct
- `context::BusyTimerGuard` struct

### Deprecated methods in rust plugins

The following deprecated methods are removed from rust plugins' API:

- `services::router::Response::map()`
- `router::event::schema::SchemaSource::File.delay` field
- `router::event::configuration::Configuration::File.delay` field
- `context::extensions::sync::ExtensionsMutex::lock()`. Use `ExtensionsMutex::with_lock()` instead.
- `test_harness::TestHarness::build()`. Use `TestHarness::build_supergraph()` instead.
- `PluginInit::new()`. Use `PluginInit::builder()` instead.
- `PluginInit::try_new()`. Use `PluginInit::try_builder()` instead.

## Upgrading to GraphOS Router v2.x

Upgrading from GraphOS Router v1.x to v2.x requires the following steps.

### Configure your Apollo usage reporting protocol

If your router v1.x is configured with `experimental_otlp_tracing_sampler`, rename it to `otlp_tracing_sampler`.

To [report operation usage metrics to GraphOS via OTLP](#apollo-operation-usage-reporting-via-otlp), you can either remove your configuration of `otlp_tracing_sampler` and use its default value, or you can explicitly enable it by setting it to [`always_on` or a sampling ratio](/router/configuration/telemetry/apollo-telemetry#configuring-usage-reporting-via-otlp).

Otherwise, to use the behavior of v1.x, turn off usage reporting via OTLP by setting `otlp_tracing_sampler` to `always_off`.

### Configure metrics reporting defaults

If you plan to use the [new metrics reporting defaults](#metrics-reporting-defaults), then no changes are required.

Otherwise, to use the defaults from v1.x, set the following:

```yaml
telemetry:
  apollo:
    signature_normalization_algorithm: legacy
    metrics_reference_mode: standard
```

### Configure supergraph endpoint path

If you use the default endpoint path or your path has no matched parameters or wildcards, then no changes are required.

If your path uses named parameters, it is now bound with a braces syntax instead of a colon:

```yaml
supergraph:
  # Previously:
  # path: /foo/:bar/baz
  path: /foo/{bar}/baz
```

If your path uses a wildcard, it must be wrapped in braces and must bind a name:

```yaml
supergraph:
  # Previously:
  # path: /foo/*
  path: /foo/{*rest}
```

### Logging

<!-- PR: https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6285 -->

If you used the `experimental_when_header` feature previously like this for example:

```yaml title="router.previous.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    logging:
      # If one of these headers matches we will log supergraph and subgraphs requests/responses
      experimental_when_header: # REMOVED
        - name: apollo-router-log-request
          value: my_client
          headers: true # default: false
          body: true # default: false
```

This feature no longer exists and can be replaced with another one included in custom telemetry. Here is how you would configure custom telemetry to achieve the same result:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router:
        request: # Display router request log
          level: info
          condition:
            eq:
              - request_header: apollo-router-log-request
              - my_client
        response: # Display router response log
          level: info
          condition:
            eq:
              - request_header: apollo-router-log-request
              - my_client
      supergraph:
        request: # Display supergraph request log
          level: info
          condition:
            eq:
              - request_header: apollo-router-log-request
              - my_client
        response:
          level: info
          condition:
            eq:
              - request_header: apollo-router-log-request
              - my_client
      subgraph:
        request: # Display subgraph request log
          level: info
          condition:
            eq:
              - supergraph_request_header: apollo-router-log-request
              - my_client
        response: # Display subgraph response log
          level: info
          condition:
            eq:
              - supergraph_request_header: apollo-router-log-request
              - my_client
```

### Introspection depth limit

The [schema-intropsection schema](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Schema-Introspection.Schema-Introspection-Schema) is recursive: a client can query the fields of the types of some other fields, and so on arbitrarily deep. This can produce responses that grow much faster than the size of the request.

To protect against abusive requests Router now refuses to execute introspection queries that nest list fields too deep and returns an error instead. The criteria matches `MaxIntrospectionDepthRule` in graphql-js, but may change in future versions.

In case it rejects legitimate queries, this check can be disabled in Router configuration:

```yaml
# Do not enable introspection in production!
supergraph:
  introspection: true # Without this, schema introspection is entirely disabled by default
limits:
  introspection_max_depth: false # Defaults to true
```

### Traces

- `telemetry.instrumentation.spans.mode` becomes `spec_compliant` by default instead of `deprecated`.

### Renamed Metrics

Some of the older metrics in the router were not using the most recent `.` naming convention and were instead separated by `_`. For consistency purposes, the following metrics are renamed:

| Previous metric | Renamed metric |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| `apollo_router_opened_subscriptions` | `apollo.router.opened.subscriptions` |
| `apollo_router_cache_hit_time` | `apollo.router.cache.hit.time` |
| `apollo_router_cache_size` | `apollo.router.cache.size` |
| `apollo_router_cache_miss_time` | `apollo.router.cache.miss.time` |
| `apollo_router_state_change_total` | `apollo.router.state.change.total` |
| `apollo_router_span_lru_size` | `apollo.router.exporter.span.lru.size` $_{[1]} |
| `apollo_router_session_count_active` | `apollo.router.session.count.active` |
| `apollo_router_uplink_fetch_count_total` | `apollo.router.uplink.fetch.count.total` |
| `apollo_router_uplink_fetch_duration_seconds` | `apollo.router.uplink.fetch.duration.seconds`|

$_{[1]} `apollo.router.exporter.span.lru.size` now also has an additional `exporter` prefix.

### Removed metrics

The following metrics have been removed:

- `apollo_router_http_request_retry_total`. This will be supported now by `http.client.request.duration` metrics
  with the `http.request.resend_count` attribute which is automatically set when `default_requirement_level` is set to `recommended`.

- `apollo_router_timeout`. This metric conflated timed-out requests from client
  to the router, and requests from the router to subgraphs. Timed-out requests
  have HTTP status code 504. Use the `http.response.status_code` attribute on the
  `http.server.request.duration` metric to identify timed-out router requests, and
  the same attribute on the `http.client.request.duration` metric to identify
  timed-out subgraph requests.

- `apollo_router_http_requests_total`. This is replaced by
  `http.server.request.duration` metric for requests from clients to router and
  `http.client.request.duration` for requests from router to subgraphs.

- `apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket`. This is replaced by
  `http.server.request.duration` metric for requests from clients to router and
  `http.client.request.duration` for requests from router to subgraphs.

- `apollo_router_session_count_total`. This is replaced by
  `http.server.active_requests`.

- `apollo_require_authentication_failure_count`. Use the
  `http.server.request.duration` metric's `http.response.status_code` attribute.
  Requests with authentication failures have HTTP status code 401.

- `apollo_authentication_failure_count`. Use the
  `apollo.router.operations.authentication.jwt` metric's
  `authentication.jwt.failed` attribute.

- `apollo_authentication_success_count`. Use the
  `apollo.router.operations.authentication.jwt` metric instead. If the
  `authentication.jwt.failed` attribute is _absent_ or `false`, the authentication
  succeeded.

- `apollo_router_deduplicated_subscriptions_total`. Use the
  `apollo.router.operations.subscriptions` metric's `subscriptions.deduplicated`
  attribute

- `apollo_router_cache_miss_count`. Cache miss count can be derived from `apollo.router.cache.miss.time.count`.

- `apollo_router_cache_hit_count`. Cache hit count can be derived from `apollo.router.cache.hit.time.count`.

- Calculating the overhead of injecting the router into your service stack when
  making multiple downstream calls is a complex task. With that, we are removing
  the following two misleading metrics and recommending that you instead test your
  workloads with the router to if the latency meets your requirements:
  - `apollo_router_span`
  - `apollo_router_processing_time`

<!-- PR: https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6621 -->

- If you used the `subgraph_response_body` selector for telemetry like this:

```yaml
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    instruments:
      subgraph:
        http.client.request.duration:
          attributes:
            http.response.status_code:
              subgraph_response_status: code
            my_data_value:
              subgraph_response_body: .data.test
```

You'll have to migrate the `subgraph_response_body` to `subgraph_response_data` selector (or `subgraph_response_errors` if you want to target errors):

```yaml
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    instruments:
      subgraph:
        http.client.request.duration:
          attributes:
            http.response.status_code:
              subgraph_response_status: code
            my_data_value:
              subgraph_response_data: $.test # Heads up, we removed the .data prefix as it's directly targeting data and we added $
```

### Context Keys

The router request context is used to share data across stages of the request pipeline. The keys have been renamed for consistency and to better indicate which pipeline stage or plugin populates the data. If you access context entries in a custom plugin, Rhai script, coprocessor, or telemetry selector, update your context keys to account for the new names:

- `apollo_authentication::JWT::claims` -> `apollo::authentication::jwt_claims`
- `apollo_authorization::authenticated::required` -> `apollo::authorization::authentication_required`
- `apollo_authorization::scopes::required` -> `apollo::authorization::required_scopes`
- `apollo_authorization::policies::required` -> `apollo::authorization::required_policies`
- `apollo_operation_id` -> `apollo::supergraph::operation_id`
- `apollo_override::unresolved_labels` -> `apollo::progressive_override::unresolved_labels`
- `apollo_override::labels_to_override` -> `apollo::progressive_override::labels_to_override`
- `apollo_router::supergraph::first_event` -> `apollo::supergraph::first_event`
- `apollo_telemetry::client_name` -> `apollo::telemetry::client_name`
- `apollo_telemetry::client_version` -> `apollo::telemetry::client_version`
- `apollo_telemetry::studio::exclude` -> `apollo::telemetry::studio_exclude`
- `apollo_telemetry::subgraph_ftv1` -> `apollo::telemetry::subgraph_ftv1`
- `cost.actual` -> `apollo::demand_control::actual_cost`
- `cost.estimated` -> `apollo::demand_control::estimated_cost`
- `cost.result` -> `apollo::demand_control::result`
- `cost.strategy` -> `apollo::demand_control::strategy`
- `experimental::expose_query_plan.enabled` -> `apollo::expose_query_plan::enabled`
- `experimental::expose_query_plan.formatted_plan` -> `apollo::expose_query_plan::formatted_plan`
- `experimental::expose_query_plan.plan` -> `apollo::expose_query_plan::plan`
- `operation_kind` -> `apollo::supergraph::operation_kind`
- `operation_name` -> `apollo::supergraph::operation_name`
- `persisted_query_hit` -> `apollo::apq::cache_hit`
- `persisted_query_register` -> `apollo::apq::registered`

### Coprocessor

We have renamed several context keys which could impact your coprocessor logic. If you don't specify the `context` configuration nothing will change. If, however, you rely on any of the impacted keys. You should update your coprocessor logic to reflect the change. If this is difficult, you can postpone this migration by relying on a new context configuration feature for coprocessors.

Prior to this change, context was a boolean argument indicating that all of context (true) or no context (false) should be passed to the coprocessor. Now it can take one of several values indicating which names, deprecated or new, you wish to pass to your coprocessor.

Finally, if you specify an array in `context` you'll have to specify only the context keys you want to send to your coprocessors. This will lower the body size of the request/response and may improve performance.

Example:

```yaml
coprocessor:
  url: http://127.0.0.1:3000 # mandatory URL which is the address of the coprocessor
  supergraph:
    request:
      context: false # Do not send any context entries
  supergraph:
    request:
      headers: true
      context: # It will only send these 2 context keys to your coprocessor
        selective:
          - apollo::supergraph::operation_name
          - apollo::demand_control::actual_cost
      body: true
    response:
      headers: true
      context: all # It will send all context keys with new names (2.x version)
      body: true
  subgraph:
    all:
      request:
        context: deprecated # It will send all the context keys with deprecated names (1.x version)
```

So if you don't want to change anything in your coprocessor you can switch `context: true` to `context: deprecated`.

<Note>
    If you use the `selective` configuration, you'll have to specify new context key names (>=2.x) it doesn't work with deprecated keys. So for example if you try to specify `operation_name` instead of `apollo::supergraph::operation_name` it won't map to the new context key.
</Note>

### Tracing

`jaeger` exporter has been removed as Jaeger fully supports to OTLP format. To use the `otlp` exporter change your router config:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    tracing:
      propagation:
        jaeger: true
      otlp:
        enabled: true
```

And ensure that you have enabled OTLP support in your Jaeger instance using `COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true` and exposing ports `4317` and or `4318` for gRPC and HTTP respectively.

### Check CORS configuration

If you already configured [CORS](../../routing/security/cors) on the router, the configuration won't change but with v1.x it accepted bad configuration and displayed an error log when some header names or regexes were invalid.
With v2.x it will end up with an error and it won't start at all to avoid confusions and misconfigurations.

### Headers propagation

<!-- PR: https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6621 -->

If you use the ability to get data from request body and insert this data in a subgraph request header, we updated the `path` field type to be [JSONPath](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-goessner-dispatch-jsonpath-00.html) compliant
So if you had this configuration for example:

```yaml
headers:
  all:
    request:
      - insert:
          name: from_app_name
          path: .extensions.metadata[0].app_name
```

You'll have to migrate the `path` field to be JSONPath compliant and just add `$` at the beginning of the `path`, example:

```yaml
headers:
  all:
    request:
      - insert:
          name: from_app_name
          path: $.extensions.metadata[0].app_name
```

### OneShotAsyncCheckpoint

This has been removed because it is incompatible with the architectural optimizations we've made in Router 2.0. If you were using this in a Rust Plugin, you can replace it easily with `AsyncCheckpoint` as follows:

Plugin code using `OneShotAsyncCheckpoint`

```
            OneShotAsyncCheckpointLayer::new(move |request: execution::Request| {
                let request_config = request_config.clone();
                <etc...>
            }
            .service(service)
            .boxed()
```

Replace with `AsyncCheckpoint`

```
            AsyncCheckpointLayer::new(move |request: execution::Request| {
                let request_config = request_config.clone();
                <etc...>
            }
            .buffered()
            .service(service)
            .boxed()
```

The `buffered()` method is provided by the `apollo_router::layers::ServiceBuilderExt` trait and ensures that you service may be cloned.

<!-- PR: https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6486 -->

### Traffic Shaping

Traffic shaping has been improved significantly in Router 2.0. We've added a new mechanism, concurrency control, and we've improved the router's ability to observe timeout and traffic shaping restrictions correctly. These improvements do mean that clients of the router may see an increase in:

- [Service Unavailable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/503)
- [Gateway Timeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/504)

errors as traffic shaping constraints are enforced.

We recommend that users experiment with their configuration in order to arrive at the right combination of timeout, concurrency and rate limit controls for their particular use case.

For more information about [configuring traffic shaping](../../routing/performance/traffic-shaping.mdx).

<!-- PR: https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6486 -->

### Subgraph Request/Response

If, in your Rust plugin, you were using either the subgraph::Request::subgraph_name or the subgraph::Response::subgraph_name, please note that these are no longer `Option`, but are mandatory.

### Emitting metrics in Rust plugins

Previously, Rust plugins could use the Router's internal metrics system using the `tracing` macros. This is no longer supported, and the opentelemetry crates should be used instead.

`tracing` field names starting with these strings are no longer treated specially:
- `counter.`
- `histogram.`
- `monotonic_counter.`
- `value.`

Instead, use the [OpenTelemetry](https://docs.rs/opentelemetry/latest/opentelemetry/) crates.
You can use the new `apollo_router::metrics::meter_provider()` API to access the router's global meter provider to register your instruments.

### Deploy your router

Make sure that you are referencing the correct router release: **{products.router.version("connectors").version}**

During upgrade, carefully monitor logs and resource consumption to ensure that your router has successfully upgraded and that your router has enough resources to perform as expected. The router will automatically migrate required configuration changes, but it is good practice to review the steps above and decide if you want to change your configuration.

For example, you may decide that you wish to change the way in which you sample OTLP traces in this new release and not simply preserve your existing configuration.

## Reporting upgrade issues
