## üöÄ Features

### Update to Federation v2.3.0 ([Issue #2465](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2465))

This brings in Federation v2.3.0-beta.3 for testing.  This will be updated to a final version before final release.

### Add optional `Access-Control-Max-Age` header to CORS plugin ([Issue #2212](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2212))

Adds new option called `max_age` that is used like this:
```
cors:
  max_age: 86400secs
```

## üêõ Fixes

### Fix panic in schema parse error reporting ([Issue #2269](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2269))

In order to support introspection,
some definitions like `type __Field { ‚Ä¶ }` are implicitly added to schemas.
This addition was done by string concatenation at the source level.
In some cases like unclosed braces, a parse error could be reported at a position
beyond the size of the original source.
This would cause a panic because only the unconcatenated string
is given the the error reporting library `miette`.

Instead, the Router now parses introspection types separately
and ‚Äúconcatenates‚Äù definitions at the AST level.

### Always accept compressed subgraph responses  ([Issue #2415](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2415))

Subgraph response decompression was only supported when subgraph request compression was configured. This is now always active.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2450

### Fix handling of root query operation not named `Query`

With such a schema, some parsing code in the Router would incorrectly
return an error because it was assuming the default name.
Similarly with a root mutation operation not named `Mutation`.

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2459

### Remove the `locations` field from subgraph errors ([Issue #2297](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2297))

Subgraph errors can come with a `locations` field indicating which part of the query was causing issues, but it refers to the subgraph query generated by the query planner, and we have no way of translating it to locations in the client query, so this field is removed for now.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2442

## üìÉ Configuration

Configuration changes will be [automatically migrated on load](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview#upgrading-your-router-configuration). However, you should update your source configuration files as these will become breaking changes in a future major release.

### `health-check` renamed to `health_check` ([Issue #2161](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2161))

The health_check key in router.yaml has been renamed to snake case for consistency. 

Before:
```yaml
health-check:
  enabled: true
```

After:
```yaml
health_check:
  enabled: true
```

## üìö Documentation

### Documentation on how to propagate headers between subgraph services ([Issue #2128](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2128))

Migrating headers between subgraph services is possible via Rhai script. An example has been added to the header propagation page.

By [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2446

### Added documentation for listening on IPv6 ([Issue #1835](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1835))

Added documentation for listening on IPv6
```yaml
supergraph:
  # The socket address and port to listen on. 
  # Note that this must be quoted to avoid interpretation as a yaml array.
  listen: '[::1]:4000'
```
