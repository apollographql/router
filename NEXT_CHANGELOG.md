# [0.9.5] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd
## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Entry point improvements ([PR #1227](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1227)) ([PR #1234](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1234)) ([PR #1239](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1239)) ([PR #1263](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1263))

The interfaces around the entry point have been improved for naming consistency and to enable reuse when customization is required. 

Most users will continue to use:
```rust
apollo_router::main()  
```

However, if you want to specify extra customization to configuration/schema/shutdown then you may use `Executable::builder()` to override behavior. 

```rust
use apollo_router::Executable;
Executable::builder()
  .router_builder_fn(|configuration, schema| ...) // Optional
  .start().await?
```

Migration tips:
* Calls to `ApolloRouterBuilder::default()` should be migrated to `ApolloRouter::builder`.
* `FederatedServerHandle` has been renamed to `ApolloRouterHandle`.
* The ability to supply your own `RouterServiceFactory` has been removed.
* `StateListener`. This made the internal state machine unnecessarily complex. `listen_address()` remains on `ApolloRouterHandle`.
* `FederatedServerHandle::shutdown()` has been removed. Instead, dropping `ApolloRouterHandle` will cause the router to shutdown.
* `FederatedServerHandle::ready()` has been renamed to `FederatedServerHandle::listen_address()`, it will return the address when the router is ready to serve requests.
* `FederatedServerError` has been renamed to `ApolloRouterError`.
* `main_rt` should be migrated to `Executable::builder()`

## üöÄ Features ( :rocket: )

### Add support for modifying variables from a plugin. [PR #1257](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1257)

Previously, it was not possible to modify variables in a `Request` from a plugin. This is now supported in both Rust and Rhai plugins.

## üêõ Fixes ( :bug: )

### Support introspection object types ([PR #1240](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1240))

Introspection queries can use a set of object types defined in the specification. The query parsing code was not recognizing them,
resulting in some introspection queries not working.

## üõ† Maintenance ( :hammer_and_wrench: )
