title: Rhai scripts for the Apollo Router
description: Extend router functionality without compiling a custom plugin
---

> ⚠️ Apollo Router support for Rhai scripting is currently experimental. For details, see [experimental limitations](#experimental-limitations).

The Apollo Router provides experimental support for scripts that use the [Rhai](http://rhai.rs) scripting language. Rhai is useful for performing common script-based tasks (manipulating strings, processing headers, etc.) in a Rust-based project.

Rhai scripts hook into the same [Apollo Router lifecycle events](./overview/#how-customizations-work) as native Rust plugins.

## Experimental limitations

Like the rest of the Apollo Router, Rhai support is in active development. During this preview, functionality is limited.

**What you can do:**
* Manipulate request HTTP headers
* Perform `checkpoint`-style short circuiting of requests
* Modify the status codes of requests/responses
* Modify the body of requests (excluding variables)

**What you can't do (yet):**
* Execute calls to external services
* Modify the body of responses

> ⚠️ As Rhai script is experimental, we may introduce breaking changes to Rhai script functionality after the general availability (GA) release of the Apollo Router. However, any required updates to your existing scripts will probably be minor.

## Configuration

```yaml
plugins:
  experimental.rhai:
    # Currently there can only be a single rhai file.  If there are multiple
    # customizations, keep them all in a single file.
    filename: "location_of_your_rhai_script.rhai"
```

## Service hooks

Similar to native Rust plugins, Rhai scripts can hook into the Apollo Router's [four services](./overview/#how-customizations-work) that handle requests. Just like  native Rust plugins, Rhai scripts use a single hook for each service. Like native Rust plugins, the script author can then choose to map requests/response and generally configure the service for different behaviour.

  - `router_service`
  - `query_planner_service`
  - `execution_service`
  - `subgraph_service`

Each of these hooks is optional—define only the functions you want to use custom logic for.

Each function takes a single parameter: `service`, this is typed for each of the different services. The various service functions are not required to return anything. If they do, the return is ignored.

The full functionality of a Rust plugin is not available, but the following methods are available for service interactions.

  - `map_request`
  - `map_response`

These can be invoked as methods on the supplied service object and are expected to provide a callback function which is invoked for actual request or response processing.

All request/response callback functions are provided with a typed Request/Response which may be interacted with to manipulate headers and context. In addition, request details (query, operation name, variables and extensions) are available to be read/written for all requests as sub-fields of the body. For example to read a request query, simply access "request.body.query" in your rhai script. The examples illustrate how to interact with request/response objects.

Note: You currently may only read the "variables" field and cannot modify it.

## Examples

### Example 1

This example illustrates how to register router request handling.

```javascript

// At the router_service stage, register callbacks for processing requests
fn router_service(service) {
    let request_callback = Fn("process_request"); // This is standard Rhai functionality for creating a function pointer
    service.map_request(request_callback); // Register the callback
}

// Generate a log for each request
fn process_request(request) {
    log_info("this is info level log message");
}
```

### Example 2

This example manipulates headers and the request context:

```javascript
// At the router_service stage, register callbacks for processing requests and
// responses.
fn router_service(service) {
    let request_callback = Fn("process_request"); // This is standard Rhai functionality for creating a function pointer
    service.map_request(request_callback); // Register the request callback
    let response_callback = Fn("process_response"); // This is standard Rhai functionality for creating a function pointer
    service.map_response(response_callback); // Register the response callback
}

// Ensure the header is present in the request
// If an error is thrown, then the request is short-circuited to an error response
fn process_request(request) {
    log_info("processing request"); // This will appear in the router log as an INFO log
    // Verify that x-custom-header is present and has the expected value
    if request.headers["x-custom-header"] != "CUSTOM_VALUE" {
        log_error("Error: you did not provide the right custom header"); // This will appear in the router log as an ERROR log
        throw "Error: you did not provide the right custom header"; // This will appear in the errors response and short-circuit the request
    }
    // Put the header into the context and check the context in the response
    request.context["x-custom-header"] = request.headers["x-custom-header"];
}

// Ensure the header is present in the response context
// If an error is thrown, then the response is short-circuited to an error response
fn process_response(response) {
    log_info("processing response"); // This will appear in the router log as an INFO log
    // Verify that x-custom-header is present and has the expected value
    if request.context["x-custom-header"] != "CUSTOM_VALUE" {
        log_error("Error: we lost our custom header from our context"); // This will appear in the router log as an ERROR log
        throw "Error: we lost our custom header from our context"; // This will appear in the errors response and short-circuit the request
    }
}
```

### Example 3

This example converts cookies into headers for transmission to subgraphs. There is a complete working example (with tests) of this in the [examples/cookies-to-headers directory](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples/cookies-to-headers).

```javascript
// Call map_request with our service and pass in a string with the name
// of the function to callback
fn subgraph_service(service) {
    print("registering request callback"); // print() is the same as using log_info()
    let request_callback = Fn("process_request");
    map_request(service, request_callback);
}

// This will convert all cookie pairs into headers.
// If you only wish to convert certain cookies, you
// can add logic to modify the processing.
fn process_request(request) {
    print("adding cookies as headers");

    // Find our cookies
    let cookies = request.headers["cookie"].split(';');
    for cookie in cookies {
        // Split our cookies into name and value
        let k_v = cookie.split('=', 2);
        if k_v.len() == 2 {
            // trim off any whitespace
            k_v[0].trim();
            k_v[1].trim();
            // update our headers
            // Note: we must update sub_headers, since we are
            // setting a header in our sub graph request
            request.sub_headers[k_v[0]] = k_v[1];
        }
    }
}
```

There are four complete working examples (with tests) of rhai in the [examples directory](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples). The rhai examples are listed in the README.md.
