## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Remove timeout from otlp exporter ([Issue #2337](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2337))

`batch_processor` configuration contains timeout, so the existing timeout property has been removed from the parent configuration element.

Before:
```yaml
telemetry:
  tracing:
    otlp:
      timeout: 5s
```
After:
```yaml
telemetry:
  tracing:
    otlp:
      batch_processor:
        timeout: 5s
```

## üöÄ Features

### Add cache hit/miss metrics ([Issue #1985](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1985))

Add several metrics around the cache.
Each cache metrics it contains `kind` attribute to know what kind of cache it was (`query planner`, `apq`, `introspection`)
and the `storage` attribute to know where the cache is coming from.

`apollo_router_cache_hit_count` to know when it hits the cache.

`apollo_router_cache_miss_count` to know when it misses the cache.

`apollo_router_cache_hit_time` to know how much time it takes when it hits the cache.

`apollo_router_cache_miss_time` to know how much time it takes when it misses the cache.

Example
```
# TYPE apollo_router_cache_hit_count counter
apollo_router_cache_hit_count{kind="query planner",new_test="my_version",service_name="apollo-router",storage="memory"} 2
# TYPE apollo_router_cache_hit_time histogram

### Add support for single instance Redis ([Issue #2300](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2300))

## üêõ Fixes

### Change the default value of `apollo.field_level_instrumentation_sampler` ([Issue #2339](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2339))

Change the default value of `apollo.field_level_instrumentation_sampler` to `always_off` instead of `0.01`

### `subgraph_request` span is set as the parent of traces coming from subgraphs ([Issue #2344](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2344))

Before this fix, the context injected in headers to subgraphs was wrong, it was not the right parent span id.

### Move APQ and EnsureQueryPresence in the router service ([PR #2296](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2296))

Moving APQ from the axum level to the supergraph service reintroduced a `Buffer` in the service pipeline.
Now the APQ and`EnsureQueryPresence ` layers are part of the router service, to remove that `Buffer`.

### Refactor yaml validation error reports ([Issue #2180](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2180))

YAML configuration file validation prints a report of the errors it encountered, but that report was missing some
information, and had small mistakes around alignment and pointing out the right line.
