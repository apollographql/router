title: Debugging Client Requests to GraphOS Router
subtitle: Log incoming requests to help debug problematic requests
description: Enable telemetry features to help gain more visibility into incoming HTTP requests and help debug issues your clients may be having.
---

By default, the GraphOS Router neither generates logs for incoming client HTTP requests nor enables telemetry features like metrics exporters.

The easiest way to see GraphQL operation data is to use [GraphOS Insights](/graphos/platform/insights). GraphOS Studio lets you analyze data such as failed requests, client IDs, and exact GraphQL errors [if enabled]](/routing/graphos-reporting#errors).

If you are having issues with client requests and want to debug them in your own environment, Apollo recommends first doing so in a non-production environment or using logic to do this on a per-request basis.

## OpenTelemetry spans and traces

Using [router telemetry](/graphos/routing/observability/telemetry), the trace for a given request will have a span labeled as `router`. These spans contain the HTTP information for a given client request with [standard router attributes](/graphos/reference/router/telemetry/instrumentation/standard-attributes#router).

These attributes include helpful information about the request and response. However, an attribute for the HTTP body text is not included. If you want to see the GraphQL operation. first check your [GraphOS Insights](/graphos/platform/insights) or follow the other options listed below.

## Request and response logging

You can include the request body in your logs conditionally using the [`experimental-when-header`](/graphos/reference/router/telemetry/log-exporters/overview#requestresponse-logging) configuration option.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    logging:
      # If one of these headers matches we will log supergraph and subgraphs requests/responses
      experimental_when_header:
        - name: apollo-router-log-request
          value: my_client
          headers: true # default: false
          body: true # default: false
```
## Rhai scripts and coprocessors

Hooking into the `RouterService` layer for either [Rhai scripts](/graphos/routing/customization/rhai) or [coprocessors](/graphos/routing/customization/coprocessor) gives you access to the full HTTP request and response before any processing takes place. You can use these customization methods to add custom logic for what to log and when.

## Debugging router logs

By default, the router uses the `info` level for its logging. [Enabling other logging levels](/graphos/reference/router/telemetry/log-exporters/overview) can help debug specific scenarios. Using non-`info` level configurations is only recommended for local or non-production environments.

## Alternative cloud services

If you are deploying the router to a cloud service, it is likely that you already have access to the raw HTTP logs through other services like load balancers. Using the trace ID or operation hash, you should be able to find specific client request logs for a particular operation. Refer to the docs for your cloud providers.
