# [0.15.1] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## ❗ BREAKING ❗


### Reorder query planner execution ([PR #1484](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1484))

Query planning is deterministic, it only depends on the query, operation name and query planning
options. As such, we can cache the result of the entire process.

This changes the pipeline to apply query planner plugins between the cache and the bridge planner,
so those plugins will only be called once on the same query. If changes must be done per query,
they should happen in a supergraph service.
