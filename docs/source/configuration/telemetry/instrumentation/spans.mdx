subtitle: Add router lifecycle context to traces
description: Use spans to add contextual information from the Apollo Router to traces displayed by your application performance monitors (APM).

import RouterServices from '../../../../shared/router-lifecycle-services.mdx';

A **span** captures contextual information about requests and responses as they're processed through the [router's request lifecycle (pipeline)](../../../customizations/overview/#the-request-lifecycle). The information from spans can be used when displaying traces in your application performance monitors (APM).

## Spans configuration

### Router request lifecycle services

<RouterServices />

The `router`, `supergraph` and `subgraph` sections are used to define custom span configuration for each service:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      router: # highlight-line
        attributes: {}
          # ...     
      supergraph: # highlight-line
        attributes: {}
          # ...
      subgraph: # highlight-line
        attributes: {}
          # ...      
```

### `attributes`

Spans may have attributes attached to them from the Apollo Router pipeline. These attributes are used to filter and group spans in your APM.

Attributes may be drawn from [standard attributes](./standard-attributes) or [selectors](./selectors). 

<PremiumFeatureFeature>

Granular customization of attributes on spans requires a GraphOS [Dedicated or Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#observability).

</PremiumFeatureFeature>

The attributes that are available depend on the service of the pipeline.

```yaml title="desc.router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      router:
        attributes:
          # Standard attributes
          http.response.status_code: true
          # Custom attributes
          "my_attribute":
            response_header: "x-my-header"
```

You can also have [conditions](./conditions) on custom attributes using [selectors](./selectors). You can only have conditions on a selector at the same execution level.
Example you can't have a condition on `response_header` if you want to set an attribute from `request_header`.

```yaml title="desc.router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans: 
      router: 
        attributes:    
          on_error: 
            response_status: reason
            condition:
              not:
                eq:
                - response_status: code
                - 200
```

### `default_attribute_requirement_level`

The `default_attribute_requirement_level` option sets the default attributes to attach to spans, as defined by [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/common/attribute-requirement-level/).

Valid values:

* `required` (default)
* `recommended`

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      # Set the default requirement level
      default_attribute_requirement_level: required #highlight-line
```

Attributes can be configured individually, so that `required` attributes can be overridden or disabled. For example, `http.response.status_code` is set individually to override the standard value:

```yaml title="desc.router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      # Set the default requirement level
      default_attribute_requirement_level: required
      router:
        attributes:
          # Disable standard attribute
          http.response.status_code: false
```

<Note>

The attributes that the OpenTelemetry spec defines as `opt-in` must be configured individually.

</Note>

### `mode` 

The `mode` option enables the router spans to either use legacy attributes in the router, or those defined in the OpenTelemetry specification.

Valid values:

* `spec_compliant` 
* `deprecated` (default)

#### `spec_compliant`
This mode follows the OpenTelemetry spec. Attributes that were previously added to spans that did not follow conventions are now removed.

You will likely gain a significant performance improvement by using this mode as it reduces the number of attributes that are added to spans.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      mode: spec_compliant
```

For now this is not the default, however it will be in a future release.

#### `deprecated`
This mode is the default and follows the previous behavior if you have not configured the `mode` option to `spec_compliant`.
```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      mode: deprecated
```
Attributes are added to spans that do not follow OpenTelemetry conventions.

<Note>

The `mode` option will be defaulted to `spec_compliant` in a future release, and eventually removed. 

</Note>

## Span status

By default spans are marked in error only if the http status code is different than 200. If you want to mark a span in error for other reason you can override the `otel.status_code` attribute which is responsible to mark a span in error or not.
If it's in error then `otel.status_code` = `error`, if not it will be `ok`.

## Naming

By default, we will use a span naming convention that aligns with the current [semantinc conventions for GraphQL server in OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/graphql/graphql-spans/) which means the root span name 
must be of format `<graphql.operation.type> <graphql.operation.name>` provided that `graphql.operation.type` and `graphql.operation.name` are available. 

If you want to change the name of spans we're creating for each services you can override this value by setting the `otel.name` attribute using any selectors you want.

Here is an example if you want to mark the `router` and `supergraph` span in error if you have a graphql error in the payload and you want to enforce the `router` span name to be `graphql_router`.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      router:
        attributes:
          otel.name:
            static: graphql_router # Override the span name to graphql_router 
          otel.status_code:
            static: error
            condition:
              eq:
              - true
              - on_graphql_error: true
      supergraph:
        attributes:
          otel.status_code:
            static: error
            condition:
              exists:
                response_errors: $[0].extensions.code # Here is an example to get the first error code, `on_graphql_error` is also available for supergraph
```

## Span configuration example

An example configuration of `telemetry.spans` in `router.yaml` sets both standard and custom attributes for the router service:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      default_attribute_requirement_level: required
      mode: spec_compliant
      router:
        attributes:
          # Standard attributes (http)
          dd.trace_id: false
          http.request.body.size: false
          http.response.body.size: false
          http.request.method: false
          # ...
  
          # Conditional custom attribute
          otel.status_description: # You can conditionally put a status description attribute on your span if it respect the condition
            static: "there was an error"
            condition: # http response status code != 200 or it contains a graphql error in the payload
              any:
              - not:
                  eq:
                  - response_status: code
                  - 200
              - eq:
                - on_graphql_error
                - true
          # Custom attributes
          "acme.custom_1":
            trace_id: datadog
          "acme.custom_2":
            response_header: "X-CUSTOM2"
            default: "unknown"
          "acme.custom_3":
            env: "ENV_VAR"
          "static_attribute":
            static: "my_static_value"
            # ...
          
      supergraph:
        attributes: {}
          # ...
      subgraph:
        attributes: {}
          # ...      
```
