title: Collecting metrics in the Apollo Router
---

The Apollo Router provides built-in support for metrics collection via [Prometheus](#using-prometheus) and [OpenTelemetry Collector](#using-opentelemetry-collector).

## Using Prometheus

You can use [Prometheus and Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) to collect metrics and visualize the router metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      # By setting this endpoint you enable the prometheus exporter
      # All our endpoints exposed by plugins are namespaced by the name of the plugin
      # Then to access to this prometheus endpoint, the full url path will be `/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus`
      enabled: true
```

Assuming you are running locally:

1. Run a query against the router.
2. Navigate to [http://localhost:4000/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus](http://localhost:4000/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus) to see something like:

```
# HELP http_request_duration_seconds Total number of HTTP requests made.
# TYPE http_request_duration_seconds histogram
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"} 1
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.9"} 1
---SNIP---
```

Note that if you have not run a query against the router you will see a blank page as no metrics will have been generated yet!

Here is the list of available metrics you'll have using Prometheus:

- HTTP router request duration
- HTTP request duration by subgraph
- Total number of HTTP requests by HTTP Status
- Total number of HTTP requests in error

## Using OpenTelemetry Collector

You may send metrics to [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) for processing and eporting metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    otlp:
      # Either 'default' or a URL
      endpoint: default

      # Optional protocol. Only grpc is supported currently.
      # Setting to http will result in configuration failure.
      protocol: grpc

      # Optional Grpc configuration
      grpc:
        domain_name: "my.domain"
        key:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        ca:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        cert:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        metadata:
          foo: bar

      # Optional timeout in humatime form
      timeout: 2s
```

## Add custom attributes/labels

If you need to add attributes/labels on your generated metrics, for example add a custom attributes/labels coming from a specific header in the original HTTP request, or insert custom attributes/labels on every metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      attributes:
        static:
          - name: "version"
            value: "v1.0.0"
        from_headers:
          - named: "content-type"
            rename: "payload_type"
            default: "application/json"
          - named: "x-custom-header-to-add"
```
