### Add description and units to standard instruments ([PR #5407](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/5407))

This PR adds description and units to standard instruments available in the router. These descriptions and units have been copy pasted directly from the [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-metrics/) and are needed for better integrations with APMs.
