Learn about error codes and HTTP response status codes returned by the Apollo Router.

## Status codes

<PropertyList kind="errCodes">
<Property name="400" short="Bad request">

A request failed GraphQL validation or failed to be parsed.

</Property>
<Property name="401" short="Unauthorized">

Requests may receive this response in two cases:

- For a client request that requires authentication, the client's JWT failed verification.
- For a non-client subscription endpoint calling a subscription callback URL, the router couldn't find a matching subscription identifier between its registered subscriptions and a subscription event.

</Property>
<Property name="405" short="Method not allowed">

A request used an unallowed HTTP method.

<Note> 

Both mutations and subscriptions must use POST.

</Note>

</Property>
<Property name="406" short="Not acceptable">

A request's HTTP `Accept` header didn't contain any of the router's supported mime-types: 
- `application/json`
- `application/graphql-response+json`
- `multipart/mixed;deferSpec=20220824`
- `multipart/mixed;subscriptionSpec=1.0`.

</Property>

<Property name="429" short="Too many requests">

Request traffic exceeded configured rate limits. See [client side traffic shaping](./configuration/traffic-shaping/#client-side-traffic-shaping).

</Property>
<Property name="499" short="Request canceled by client">

The request was canceled because the client closed the connection, possibly due to a client side timeout.

</Property>
<Property name="500" short="Internal server error">

The router encountered an unexpected issue. [Report](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/new?assignees=&labels=raised+by+user&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=) this possible bug to the router team.

</Property>

<Property name="504" short="Request timed out">

The request was not able to complete within a configured amount of time.  See [client side traffic shaping timeouts](./configuration/traffic-shaping/#timeouts).

</Property>
</PropertyList>

<Note>

You can create Rhai scripts that throw custom status codes. See [Terminating client requests](./customizations/rhai-api#terminating-client-requests) to learn more.
