> For installation instructions, see the [quickstart](../quickstart/).

You run the Apollo Router with the following command (assuming you're in the same directory as the `router` executable):

```bash
./router --config router.yaml --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
```

Arguments for this command are described below.

## Environment variables

If you're using the Apollo Router with [managed federation](/federation/managed-federation/overview/), set these environment variables in its startup command:

```bash
APOLLO_KEY="..." APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="..." ./router
```

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Environment Variable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr class="required">
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`

</td>
<td>

The graph ref of the registered Apollo graph and variant that the router fetches its supergraph schema from.

**Required** if using managed federation.

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="required">
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `APOLLO_KEY`

</td>
<td>

The [graph API key](/studio/api-keys/#graph-api-keys) that the Apollo Router should use to authenticate with Apollo Studio when fetching its supergraph schema.

**Required** if using managed federation.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Command arguments

Where indicated, some of these arguments can also be set via an environment variable. Command-line arguments always take precedence over environment variables if an option is provided both ways.

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Argument / Environment Variable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `-s` / `--supergraph`

`APOLLO_ROUTER_SUPERGRAPH_PATH`

</td>
<td>

The absolute or relative path to the Apollo Router's [supergraph schema](/federation/federated-types/overview/#supergraph-schema).

To learn how to compose your supergraph schema with the Rover CLI, see the [Federation quickstart](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/quickstart/#3-compose-the-supergraph-schema).

## YAML config file

The Apollo Router takes an optional YAML configuration file as input via the `--config` option. If the `--hot-reload` flag is also passed (or the `APOLLO_ROUTER_HOT_RELOAD` environment variable is set to `true`), the router automatically restarts when changes to the configuration file are made.

This file enables you to customize the router's behavior in many ways:

### Listen address

By default, the router starts an HTTP server that listens on `127.0.0.1:4000`. You can specify a different address like so:

```yaml title="router_unix.yaml"
#
# server: Configuration of the HTTP server
#
server:
  # The socket address and port to listen on
  # (Defaults to 127.0.0.1:4000)
  listen: 127.0.0.1
```

The router can also listen on a Unix socket (not supported on Windows):

```yaml title="router_unix.yaml"
server:
  # Absolute path to a Unix socket
  listen: /tmp/router.sock
```

### Endpoint path

By default, the router starts an HTTP server that exposes a `POST`/`GET` endpoint at path `/`.

You can change this path by setting `server.endpoint`:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
#
# server: Configuration of the HTTP server
#
server:
  # The exposed endpoint to answer to GraphQL queries
  # (Defaults to /)
  endpoint: /graphql
```

The endpoint path must start with `/`.

Path parameters and wildcards are supported. For example:

- `/:my_dynamic_prefix/graphql` matches both `/my_project_a/graphql` and `/my_project_b/graphql`.
- `/graphql/*` matches `/graphql/my_project_a` and `/graphql/my_project_b`.

> **Note:** The router does _not_ support wildcards in the _middle_ of a path (e.g., `/*/graphql`). Instead, use a path parameter.

### Introspection

By default, the router answers to some introspection queries. You can override this behavior to disable the introspection like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
#
# server: Configuration of the HTTP server
#
server:
  introspection: false
```

### Landing page

By default, the router displays a landing page if you access its endpoint path via your browser. You can override this behavior to disable the landing page like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
#
# server: Configuration of the HTTP server
#
server:
  landing_page: false
```

### Subgraph routing URLs

By default, the Apollo Router extracts the routing URL for each of your subgraphs from the composed supergraph schema you provide it. In most cases, no additional configuration is required.

However, if you _do_ need to override a particular subgraph's routing URL (for example, to handle changing network topography), you can do so in your YAML configuration file with the `override_subgraph_url` option:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
override_subgraph_url:
  accounts: http://localhost:8080
```

In this example, the `accounts` subgraph URL is overridden to point to `http://localhost:8080`. The URL specified in the supergraph schema is ignored.

Subgraphs _not_ included in the `override_subgraph_url` list continue to use the routing URL specified in the supergraph schema.

### HTTP header rules

See [Sending HTTP headers to subgraphs](./header-propagation/).

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

See [Configuring CORS in the Apollo Router](./cors).

### OpenTelemetry tracing

See [Tracing in the Apollo Router](./tracing/).

### Automatic persisted queries (APQ)

Automatic Persisted Queries (APQ) enable GraphQL clients to send a server the _hash_ of their query string, _instead of_ the query string itself. This can significantly reduce network usage for very large query strings.

The Apollo Router automatically supports APQ via its in-memory cache. **No configuration options are supported at this time.** Support for external data stores like Redis and Memcached will be supported in a future release.

For more information on APQ, including client configuration, see [this article](/apollo-server/performance/apq/).

### Plugins

You can customize the Apollo Router's behavior with [plugins](../customizations/overview). Each plugin can have its own section in the configuration file with arbitrary values:

```yaml {4,8} title="example-plugin-router.yaml"
plugins:
  example.plugin:
    var1: "hello"
    var2: 1
```

### Environment variable expansion

You can reference environment variables directly in your YAML file. This is useful for referencing secrets without including them in the file.

Unix-style expansion is used. For example:

- `${ENV_VAR_NAME}` expands to the value of environment variable `ENV_VAR_NAME`.
- `${ENV_VAR_NAME:some_default}` expands to the value of environment variable `ENV_VAR_NAME`, or falls back to the value `some_default` if the environment variable is not defined.

Environment variable expansions are valid only for YAML _values_, not keys:

```yaml {4,8} title="router.yaml"
server:
  listen: "${MY_LISTEN_ADDRESS}"
example:
  password: "${MY_PASSWORD}"
```

### Reusing configuration

You can reuse parts of your configuration file in multiple places using standard YAML aliasing syntax:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
headers:
  subgraphs:
    products:
      - insert: &insert_custom_header
          name: "custom-header"
          value: "something"
    reviews:
      - insert: *insert_custom_header
```

Here, the `name` and `value` entries under `&insert_custom_header` are reused under `*insert_custom_header`.

## Configuration awareness in your text editor

The Apollo Router can generate a JSON schema for config validation in your text editor. This schema helps you format the YAML file correctly and also provides content assist.

Generate the schema with the following command:

```bash
./router --schema > configuration_schema.json
```

After you generate the schema, configure your text editor. Here are the instructions for some commonly used editors:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings)
- [Emacs](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-yaml)
- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/json.html#ws_json_using_schemas)
- [Sublime](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-yaml)
- [Vim](https://github.com/Quramy/vison)
