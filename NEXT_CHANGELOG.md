## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó
### Span client_name and client_version attributes renamed ([#1514](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1514))
OpenTelemetry attributes should be grouped by `.` rather than `_`, therefore the following attributes have changed:

* `client_name` => `client.name`
* `client_version` => `client.version`

## üöÄ Features

### Provide access to the supergraph SDL from rhai scripts ([Issue #1735](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1735))

There is a new global constant `apollo_sdl` which can be use to read the
supergraph SDL as a string.

### Add federated tracing support to Apollo studio usage reporting ([#1514](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1514))

Add support of [federated tracing](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/metrics/) in Apollo Studio:

```yaml
telemetry:
    apollo:
        # The percentage of requests will include HTTP request and response headers in traces sent to Apollo Studio.
        # This is expensive and should be left at a low value.
        # This cannot be higher than tracing->trace_config->sampler
        field_level_instrumentation_sampler: 0.01 # (default)
        
        # Include HTTP request and response headers in traces sent to Apollo Studio
        send_headers: # other possible values are all, only (with an array), except (with an array), none (by default)
            except: # Send all headers except referer
            - referer

        # Send variable values in Apollo in traces sent to Apollo Studio
        send_variable_values: # other possible values are all, only (with an array), except (with an array), none (by default)
            except: # Send all variable values except for variable named first
            - first
    tracing:
        trace_config:
            sampler: 0.5 # The percentage of requests that will generate traces (a rate or `always_on` or `always_off`)
```

## üêõ Fixes

### Set correctly hasNext for the last chunk of a deferred response ([#1687](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1687))

You no longer will receive a last chunk `{"hasNext": false}` in a deferred response.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Add errors vec in `QueryPlannerResponse` to handle errors in `query_planning_service` ([PR #1504](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1504))

We changed `QueryPlannerResponse` to:

+ Add a `Vec<apollo_router::graphql::Error>`
+ Make the query plan optional, so that it is not present when the query planner encountered a fatal error. Such an error would be in the `Vec`
