# Any package that starts with `opentelemetry` needs to be updated with care
# because it is tightly intertwined with the `tracing` packages on account of

# tracked in https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1407.

# To codify this with code, a rule in our Renovate configuration constraints and
# groups `^tracing` and `^opentelemetry*` dependencies together as of
# https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1509.  A comment which exists
# there (and on `tracing` packages below) should be updated should this change.
