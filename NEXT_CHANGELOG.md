## ❗ BREAKING ❗
## 🚀 Features ( :rocket: )

### helm chart now supports prometheus metrics [PR #1005](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1005)
The router has supported exporting prometheus metrics for a while. This change updates our helm chart to enable router deployment prometheus metrics. 

Configure by updating your values.yaml or by specifying the value on your helm install command line.

e.g.: helm install --set router.configuration.telemetry.metrics.prometheus.enabled=true <etc...>

Note: prometheus metrics are not enabled by default in the helm chart.

### Configuration for Jaeger/Zipkin agent requires an URL instead of a socket address [PR #1018](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1018)
The router now support URL for a Jaeger or Zipkin agent. So you are able to provide this kind of configuration:
```yaml
telemetry:
  tracing:
    trace_config:
      service_name: router
    jaeger:
      agent:
        endpoint: jaeger:14268
```

### Add documentation for the endpoint configuration in server ([PR #1000](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1000))
Documentation about setting a custom endpoint path for GraphQL queries has been added.

## 🐛 Fixes ( :bug: )

### Fix a panic in Zipkin telemetry configuration [PR #1019](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1019)
