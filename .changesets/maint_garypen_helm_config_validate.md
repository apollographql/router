### Use kubeconform to validate the router helm manifest ([Issue #1914](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1914))

We've had problems with errors being introduced to our helm charts, see [this fix](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2788) for an example of when a fix was required. So far, we've been relying on manual testing and inspection, but we've reached the point where automation is required. This change uses [kubeconform](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform) to ensure that the YAML generated by our helm manifest is valid. Errors may still be possible, but this should at least prevent basic errors from occurring.
