    # adding the headers in the CSRF section
    # and not here would fail the OPTIONS preflight
    # you can:
    # - either add them here to be explicit
    # - or not set the `allow_headers` key at all.
    # the default behavior is `mirror_request`,
    # which mirrors the received
    # `access-control-request-headers` preflight has sent

      - x-my-custom-required-header

  # you could set unsafe_disabled: true, but That wouldn't be safe https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF

  # pick required headers that are custom enough
  # to make sure browsers would need to have added them with javascript,
  # which would trigger a preflight https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#what_requests_use_cors
  # `content-type` is not a safe idea for example.
  required_headers:
    - x-my-custom-required-header # we will look for presence of this header...
    - x-and-an-other-required-header # ...or that one if a request was made with a `simple` content type https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests
