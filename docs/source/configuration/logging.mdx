title: Logging in the Apollo Router
---

import { Link } from "gatsby";

The Apollo Router accepts a command-line argument to set its log level:

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `--log`

</td>
<td>

The log level, indicating the _most_ severe log message type to include. In ascending order of verbosity, can be one of: `off`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace`.

The default value is `info`.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

The router also accepts both `RUST_LOG` and `APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG` environment variables with the same possible values as the command-line argument. The precedence is as follows (top to bottom):
 - RUST_LOG
 - command-line argument
 - APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG

`RUST_LOG` is supported for advanced users with specific filtering requirements who may wish to see log messages from crates consumed by the router. Most users should use the command-line argument or APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG. Both of these options constrain log output to the router.

To be clear:

```
RUST_LOG=apollo_router::debug
APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG=debug
--log=debug
```

are equivalent, as are:

```
RUST_LOG=hyper=debug,apollo_router::info,h2=trace
APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG=hyper=debug,info,h2=trace
--log=hyper=debug,info,h2=trace
```

In both examples, the actual filter used by the router is as defined in the RUST_LOG entry.

For more information about specifying filters for more granular control over Apollo Router logging, see the [Env Logger documentation](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/).

## Output formats

The Apollo Router supports two logging formats:

- [Basic logging](#basic-logging-via-shell), primarily for local development
- [JSON-formatted logging](#json-formatted-logging), for compatibility with searchable logging tools like Google Cloud Logging

The router uses basic logging whenever an interactive shell session is attached, and it uses JSON-formatted logging otherwise (e.g., in CI and deployed environments). You can also enforce a specific format in configuration.

### Basic logging via shell

Basic logging is mostly used during local development:

```
2022-03-18T10:28:11.090054Z  INFO apollo_router::executable: apollo-router@0.1.0-alpha.9
2022-03-18T10:28:11.160650Z  INFO apollo_router: Starting Apollo Router
2022-03-18T10:28:11.339906Z  INFO apollo_router: Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4000 ðŸš€
```

### JSON-formatted logging

JSON-formatted logging provides compatibility with common searchable logging tools like Google Cloud Logging. The Apollo Router uses the popular Bunyan format:

```json
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:41.926942Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"apollo-router@0.1.0-alpha.9"},"target":"apollo_router::executable"}
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:41.985121Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Starting Apollo Router"},"target":"apollo_router"}
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:42.171173Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4000 ðŸš€"},"target":"apollo_router"}
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:43.453993Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Stopped"},"target":"apollo_router"}
```

## Basic configuration

> This is part of an experimental feature, it means any time until it's stabilized (without the prefix `experimental_`) we might change the configuration shape or adding/removing features.
> If you want to give feedback or participate in that feature feel free to join [this discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/1961).

By default, the router _doesn't_ log certain values that might contain sensitive data, even if a sufficient log level is set:

 - Request bodies
 - Response bodies
 - Headers 

You can enable selective logging of these values via the `when_header` option:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  experimental_logging:
    format: json # By default it's "pretty" if you are in an interactive shell session
    display_filename: true # Display filename where the log is coming from. Default: true
    display_line_number: false # Display line number in the file where the log is coming from. Default: true
    # If one of these headers matches we will log supergraph and subgraphs requests/responses
    when_header:
      - name: apollo-router-log-request
        value: my_client
        headers: true # default: false
        body: true # default: false
      # log request for all requests coming from Iphones
      - name: user-agent
        match: ^Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone*
        headers: true
```
