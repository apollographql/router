title: Export traces to Datadog
description: Collect and export tracing information from the Apollo Router
---

Enable and configure the [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) exporter endpoint in the Apollo Router.

For general tracing configuration, refer to [Router Tracing Configuration](./overview).

## OTLP configuration

To export traces to Datadog via OTLP, you must both 

- Configure the Datadog agent to accept OTLP traces, and
- Configure the router to send traces to the Datadog agent.

To configure the Datadog agent, add OTLP configuration to your `datadog.yaml`. For example:

```yaml title="datadog.yaml"
otlp_config:
  receiver:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: <dd-agent-ip>:4317
```

To configure the router, enable OTLP metrics and set both `temporality: delta` and `endpoint: <datadog-agent-endpoint>`. For example: 

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
     tracing:
       otlp:
         enabled: true
   
         # Optional endpoint, either 'default' or a URL (Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:4317)
         endpoint: "${env.DATADOG_AGENT_HOST}:4317"
```

For more details about Datadog configuration, see [Datadog Agent configuration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/otlp_ingest_in_the_agent/?tab=host).

## Native configuration

The Apollo Router can be configured to connect to either the native, default Datadog agent address or a URL.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
     tracing:
       datadog:
         enabled: true
         # Optional endpoint, either 'default' or a URL (Defaults to http://localhost:8126/v0.4/traces)
         endpoint: "http://${env.DATADOG_AGENT_HOST}:8126/v0.4/traces"
```

### `enabled`
### `enable_span_mapping`

[There are some incompatibilities](https://docs.rs/opentelemetry-datadog/latest/opentelemetry_datadog/#quirks) between Datadog and OpenTelemetry, the Datadog exporter might not provide meaningful contextual information in the exported spans. To fix this, you can configure the Apollo Router to perform a mapping for the span name and the span resource name.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
     tracing:
       datadog:
         enabled: true
         enable_span_mapping: true
```

When `enable_span_mapping: true`, the Apollo Router will perform the following mapping:

1. Use the Open Telemetry span name to set the Datadog span operation name.
2. Use the Open Telemetry span attributes to set the Datadog span resource name.


#### Example trace

Let's say we send a query `MyQuery` to the Apollo Router, then the Router using the operation's query plan will send a query to `my-subgraph-name` and the following trace will be created:

```
    | apollo_router request                                                                 |
        | apollo_router router                                                              |
            | apollo_router supergraph                                                      |
            | apollo_router query_planning  | apollo_router execution                       |
                                                | apollo_router fetch                       |
                                                    | apollo_router subgraph                |
                                                        | apollo_router subgraph_request    |
```

As you can see, there is no clear information about the name of the query, the name of the subgraph, and the name of the query sent to the subgraph.

Instead, when `enable_span_mapping` is set to `true` the following trace will be created:

```
    | request /graphql                                                                                   |
        | router                                                                                         |
            | supergraph MyQuery                                                                         |
                | query_planning MyQuery  | execution                                                    |
                                              | fetch fetch                                              |
                                                  | subgraph my-subgraph-name                            |
                                                      | subgraph_request MyQuery__my-subgraph-name__0    |
```
