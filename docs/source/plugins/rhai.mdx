- Explain the life-cycle ordering (clarify that it's before all other native plugins?)
- Give examples

If you have specific needs that requires you to write your own plugin but you don't want to learn Rust and you want to use a scripting language, rather than a compiled language, you can use [`rhai`](http://rhai.rs) script to implement some business logic in Router.

The rhai plugin is using the same mechanisms as native Rust plugins and has access to the same life-cycle events.

### Example

#### Configuration

```yaml
rhai:
    filename: "location_of_your_rhai_script.rhai"
```

> TODO: Define terminology like Service

#### Script

Here is a rhai script that manipulates headers and the request context in addition to modifying the response. Every listed function takes a `context` as parameter with `extensions` and `headers` inside and must return an updated `context`.

```javascript
fn execution_service_request(context) {
    if context.headers["x-custom-header"] != "CUSTOM_VALUE" {
        throw "Error: you did not provide the right custom header";
    }
}

fn router_service_response(context) {
    context.headers["test-header"] = "here is a test";
    // Header names are always in lower case
    if context.headers["x-custom-header"] == "CUSTOM_VALUE" {
        context.headers.greetings = "hello";
    }
    let value = context.extensions.test + 10;
    context.headers["coming_from_extensions"] = `value_${value}`;
    context.extensions.test = 42;
    context.extensions.addition = "Here is a new element in the context";

    context
}

// Other available functions:
// 
// query_planning_service_request
// query_planning_service_response
// execution_service_request
// execution_service_response
// subgraph_service_request
// subgraph_service_response
```
