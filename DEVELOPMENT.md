# Development

Rust implementation of federation router.

## Crates

- `configuration` - Config model and loading.
- `query planner` - Query plan model and a caching wrapper for calling out to the nodejs query planner.
- `execution` - Converts a query plan to a stream.
- `server` - Handles requests,
  obtains a query plan from the query planner,
  obtains an execution pipeline,
  returns the results

## Binaries

- `router` - Starts a server.

## Development

We recommend using [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to make sure your
nodejs and rust versions are correct. The versions currently used to compile
are specified in [.tool-versions](.tool-versions). To set up your toolchain
run:

```shell
asdf add-plugin rust
asdf add-plugin nodejs
asdf install
asdf reshim
```

The `router-bridge` dependency requires building a nodejs project. This should
happen automatically, but may take some time.

Set up your git hooks:

```shell
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/
```

### Getting started

Use `cargo build --all-targets` to build the project.

Some tests run against the existing Node.js implementation of the router. This
requires that the `federation-demo` project is running:

- If you have Docker and Docker Compose installed:

  ```shell
  git submodule update --recursive --init
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

  **Note:** `-d` is for running into background. You can remove `-d` if you
  have issues and you want to see the logs or if you want to run the service
  in foreground.

- Otherwise:

  You will need Node.js and npm to be installed. It is known to be working on
  Node.js 16 and npm 7.18.

  ```shell
  git submodule sync --recursive
  git submodule update --recursive --init
  cd examples/nodejs/federation-demo
  npm install;
  npm run start
  ```

Go to https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer to make queries and
http://localhost:16686/ to reach Jaeger.

### Strict linting

While developing locally doc warnings and other lint checks are disabled.
This limits the noise generated while exploration is taking place.

When you are ready to create a PR, run a build with strict checking enabled.
Use `scripts/ci-build.sh` to perform such a build.
