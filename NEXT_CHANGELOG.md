# [0.9.5] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd
## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Entry point improvements ([PR #1227](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1227)) ([PR #1234](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1234)) ([PR #1239](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1239))

The interfaces around the entry point have been improved for naming consistency and to enable reuse when customization is required. 

Most users will continue to use:
```rust
apollo_router::main()  
```

However, if you want to specify your own tokio runtime and or provide some extra customization to configuration/schema/shutdown then you may use `Executable::builder()` to override behavior. 

```rust
use apollo_router::Executable;
Executable::builder()
  .runtime(runtime) // Optional
  .router_builder_fn(|configuration, schema| ...) // Optional
  .start()?
```

Migration tips:
* Calls to `ApolloRouterBuilder::default()` should be migrated to `ApolloRouter::builder`.
* `FederatedServerHandle` has been renamed to `ApolloRouterHandle`.
* The ability to supply your own `RouterServiceFactory` has been removed.
* `StateListener`. This made the internal state machine unnecessarily complex. `listen_address()` remains on `ApolloRouterHandle`.
* `FederatedServerHandle::shutdown()` has been removed. Instead, dropping `ApolloRouterHandle` will cause the router to shutdown.
* `FederatedServerHandle::ready()` has been renamed to `FederatedServerHandle::listen_address()`, it will return the address when the router is ready to serve requests.
* `FederatedServerError` has been renamed to `ApolloRouterError`.
* `main_rt` should be migrated to `Executable::builder()`

## üöÄ Features ( :rocket: )

### Add support of multiple uplink URLs [PR #1210](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1210)

Add support of multiple uplink URLs with a comma-separated list in `APOLLO_UPLINK_ENDPOINTS` and for `--apollo-uplink-endpoints`

Example: 
```bash
export APOLLO_UPLINK_ENDPOINTS="https://aws.uplink.api.apollographql.com/, https://uplink.api.apollographql.com/"
```

### Add trace logs for parsing recursion consumption ([PR #1222](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1222))
Apollo Parser now includes recursion limits which can be examined after parse execution. The router logs these
out at trace level. You can see them in your logs by searching for "recursion_limit". For example, if json logging,
and using `jq` to filter the output:
```
router -s ../graphql/supergraph.graphql -c ./router.yaml --log trace | jq -c '. | select(.fields.message == "recursion limit data")'        
{"timestamp":"2022-06-10T15:01:02.213447Z","level":"TRACE","fields":{"message":"recursion limit data","recursion_limit":"recursion limit: 4096, high: 0"},"target":"apollo_router::spec::schema"}
{"timestamp":"2022-06-10T15:01:02.261092Z","level":"TRACE","fields":{"message":"recursion limit data","recursion_limit":"recursion limit: 4096, high: 0"},"target":"apollo_router::spec::schema"}
{"timestamp":"2022-06-10T15:01:07.642977Z","level":"TRACE","fields":{"message":"recursion limit data","recursion_limit":"recursion limit: 4096, high: 4"},"target":"apollo_router::spec::query"}
```
This is indicating that the maximum recursion limit is 4096 and that the query we processed caused us to recurse 4 times.

### Support introspection object types ([PR #1240](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1240))

Introspection queries can use a set of object types defined in the specification. The query parsing code was not recognizing them,
resulting in some introspection queries not working.
