## The health endpoint

The router supports a health endpoint. If you have a router running on your localhost at port 4000, you can access it using curl as follows:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:4000/.well-known/apollo/server-health"
{"status":"pass"}
```

This health endpoint can be used to check the health of the router. It will always return a status of pass if all is well.
