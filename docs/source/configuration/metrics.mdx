title: Collecting metrics in the Apollo Router
---

The Apollo Router provides built-in support for metrics collection via [Prometheus](#using-prometheus) and [OpenTelemetry Collector](#using-opentelemetry-collector).

## Using Prometheus

You can use [Prometheus and Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) to collect metrics and visualize the router metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      # By setting this endpoint you enable the prometheus exporter
      # All our endpoints exposed by plugins are namespaced by the name of the plugin
      # Then to access to this prometheus endpoint, the full url path will be `/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus`
      enabled: true
```

Assuming you're running locally:

1. Run a query against the router.
2. Navigate to [http://localhost:4000/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus](http://localhost:4000/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus) to see something like:

```
# HELP http_request_duration_seconds Total number of HTTP requests made.
# TYPE http_request_duration_seconds histogram
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"} 1
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.9"} 1
---SNIP---
```

> Note that if you haven't run a query against the router yet, you'll see a blank page because no metrics have been generated!

The following metrics are available using Prometheus:

- HTTP router request duration (`http_request_duration_seconds_bucket`)
- HTTP request duration by subgraph (`http_request_duration_seconds_bucket` with attribute `subgraph`)
- Total number of HTTP requests by HTTP Status (`http_requests_total`)
- Total number of HTTP requests in error (`http_requests_error_total`)

## Using OpenTelemetry Collector

You can send metrics to [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) for processing and reporting metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    otlp:
      # Either 'default' or a URL
      endpoint: default

      # Optional protocol. Only grpc is supported currently.
      # Setting to http will result in configuration failure.
      protocol: grpc

      # Optional Grpc configuration
      grpc:
        domain_name: "my.domain"
        key:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        ca:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        cert:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        metadata:
          foo: bar

      # Optional timeout in humatime form
      timeout: 2s
```

## Adding custom attributes/labels

You can add custom attributes (OpenTelemetry) and labels (Prometheus) to your generated metrics. You can apply these across _all_ requests, or you can selectively apply them based on the details of a particular request. These details include:

* The presence of a particular HTTP header
* The value at a particular JSON path within a request or response body (either from a subgraph or from the router itself)
    * [See examples of querying a JSON path.](#example-json-path-queries)
* A custom value provided via the router plugin context

Examples of all of these are shown in the file below:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      attributes:
        router: # Attribute configuration for requests to/responses from the router
          static:
            - name: "version"
              value: "v1.0.0"
          request:
            header:
              - named: "content-type"
                rename: "payload_type"
                default: "application/json"
              - named: "x-custom-header-to-add"
          response:
            body:
              # Apply the value of the provided path of the router's response body as an attribute
              - path: .errors[0].extensions.status
                name: error_from_body
          context:
            # Apply the indicated element from the plugin chain's context as an attribute
            - named: my_key
        subgraph: # Attribute configuration for requests to/responses from subgraphs
          all:
            static:
              # Always apply this attribute to all metrics for all subgraphs
              - name: kind
                value: subgraph_request
          subgraphs:
            my_subgraph_name: # Apply these rules only for the subgraph named `my_subgraph_name`
              request:
                header:
                  - named: "x-custom-header"
                body:
                  # Apply the value of the provided path of the router's request body as an attribute (here it's the query)
                  - path: .query
                    name: query
                    default: UNKNOWN
```

### Example JSON path queries

Let's say you have a JSON request body with the following structure:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "unwanted": 7,
      "wanted": { "x": 3, "y": 7 },
      "array": [3, 2, 1]
    },
    {
      "isImportant": true
    }
  ]
}
```

To fetch the value of the field `isImportant`, the corresponding path is `.items[1].isImportant`.

To fetch the value of the field `x`, the corresponding path is `.items[0].wanted.x`.

JSON path queries always begin with a period `.`

## Adding custom resources

Resources are similar to [attributes](#adding-custom-attributeslabels), but there are more globals. They're configured directly on the metrics exporter, which means they're always present on each of your metrics.

As an example, it can be useful to set a `service.name` resource to help you identify metrics related to a particular service:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      resources:
        # Set the service name to easily find metrics related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
        service.name: "apollo-router"
```

> [See OpenTelemetry conventions for resources.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/README.md)
>
> For example, if you want to use a Datadog agent and specify a service name, you should set the `service.name` resource as shown above and described in the conventions document.
