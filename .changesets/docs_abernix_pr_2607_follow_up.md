### Indicate that `apollo_router_cache_size` is a count of cache entries

This follows-up [PR #2607](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2607) which added `apollo_router_cache_size`.  It adds `apollo_router_cache_size` to the documntation and indicates that this is the number of cache entries (that is, a count).
