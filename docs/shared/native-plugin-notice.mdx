<Note>
⚠️ Apollo doesn't recommend creating native plugins for the Apollo Router Core or GraphOS Router, for the following reasons:

- Native plugins require familiarity with programming in Rust.
- Native plugins require compiling a custom router binary from source, which can introduce unexpected behavior in your router that's difficult to diagnose and support.

For most router customizations, Apollo recommends creating either a [Rhai script](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/customization/rhai/) or an [external coprocessor](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/coprocessor). Both options provide strong separation of concerns and fault isolation. Both options are also officially supported by Apollo.

While you can still use native plugins and custom router binaries, Apollo Support cannot provide troubleshooting support or fixes for these customizations. 

If you must create a native plugin, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues), and Apollo can investigate adding the custom capability to the stock router binary.
