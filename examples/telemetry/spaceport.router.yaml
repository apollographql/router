    # By default, Apollo Router runs an internal collector. You can override
    # this default behavior by setting `external: true`. If `true`, no reporting
    # agent spawns, and the router instead communicates with `collector` below.

    # If `external` is `true`, this should be the location of a spaceport
    # that's running external from the Router. Omit otherwise.

    # If `external` is `false`, this is the interface and port to listen on.
