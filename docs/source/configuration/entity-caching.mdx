Learn how the Apollo Router can cache subgraph query responses using Redis to improve your query latency for entities in the supergraph.

## Overview

An entity gets its fields from one or more subgraphs. To respond to a client request for an entity, the Apollo Router must make multiple subgraph requests. Different clients requesting the same entity can make redundant, identical subgraph requests. 

Entity caching enables the router to respond to identical subgraph queries with cached subgraph responses. The router uses Redis to cache data from subgraph query responses. Because cached data is keyed per subgraph and entity, different clients making the same client query&mdash;with the same or different query arguments&mdash;hit the same cache entries of subgraph response data.

### Benefits of entity caching

Compared to caching entire client responses, entity caching supports finer control over:
- the time to live (TTL) of cached data
- the amount of data being cached 

When caching an entire client response, the router must store it with a shorter TTL because application data can change often. Real-time data needs more frequent updates.

A client-response cache might not be shareable between users, because the application data might contain personal and private information. A client-response cache might also duplicate a lot of data between client responses.

For example, consider the `Products` and `Inventory` subgraphs from the [Entities guide](/federation/entities):

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Products subgraph" disableCopy=true
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int
}
```

```graphql title="Inventory subgraph" disableCopy=true
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  inStock: Boolean!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Assume the client for a shopping cart application requests the following for each product in the cart:
- The product's name and price from the `Products` subgraph.
- The product's availability in inventory from the `Inventory` subgraph.

If caching the entire client response, it would require a short TTL because the cart data can change often and the real-time inventory has to be up to date. A client-response cache couldn't be shared between users, because each cart is personal.  A client-response cache might also duplicate data because the same products might appear in multiple carts.

With entity caching enabled for this example, the router can:
- Store each product's description and price separately with a long TTL.
- Minimize the number of subgraph requests made for each client request, with some client requests fetching all product data from the cache and requiring no subgraph requests.
- Share the product cache between all users.
- Cache the cart per user, with a small amount of data.
- Cache inventory data with a short TTL or not cache it at all.

## Use entity caching

Follow this guide to enable and configure entity caching in the Apollo Router.

### Prerequisites

To use entity caching in the Apollo Router, you must set up:

- A Redis instance or cluster that your router instances can communicate with
- A [GraphOS Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/) that [connects your router to GraphOS](./overview/#environment-variables).

### Configure router for entity caching

In `router.yaml`, configure `preview_entity_cache`:
- Enable entity caching globally.
- Configure Redis using the same conventions described in [distributed caching](./distributed-caching#redis-url-configuration).
- Configure entity caching per subgraph, with overrides per subgraph for disabling entity caching and TTL.

For example:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
# Enable entity caching globally
preview_entity_cache:
  enabled: true

  # Configure Redis
  redis:
    urls: ["redis://..."]
    timeout: 5ms # Optional, by default: 2ms
    ttl: 24h # Optional, by default no expiration

  subgraph:
    all:
      enabled: true
    # Configure entity caching per subgraph, overrides options from the "all" section
    subgraphs:
      products:
        ttl: 120s # overrides the global TTL
      inventory:
        enabled: false # disable for a specific subgraph
      accounts:
        private_id: "user_id"
```

### Configure time to live (TTL)

To decide whether to cache an entity, the Apollo Router honors the [`Cache-Control` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) returned with the subgraph response. Since `Cache-Control` might not contain a `max-age` or `s-max-age` option, a default TTL must be configured, either defined in the per subgraph configuration or inherited from the global configuration. The Apollo Router also generates a `Cache-Control` header for the client response by aggregating the TTL information from all response parts. If a subgraph did not return the header, its response will be assumed to be `no-store`.

### Customize Redis cache key

If you need to store data for a particular request in different cache entries, you can configure the cache key through the `apollo_entity_cache::key` context entry.

This entry contains an object with the `all` field to affect all subgraph requests under one client request, and fields named after subgraph operation names to affect individual subgraph queries. The field's value can be any valid JSON value (object, string, etc).

```json
{
    "all": 1,
    "subgraph_operation1": "key1",
    "subgraph_operation2": {
      "data": "key2"
    }
}

```

### Private information caching

A subgraph might return a response with the header `Cache-Control: private`, indicating that it contains user personalized data. usually, this would forbid intermediate servers from storing data, but the Apollo Router may actually be able to recognize different users, and store their data in different parts of the cache.

To set up private information caching, the `private_id` option must be configured. It is a string pointing at a field in the request context, that contains data used to recognize users (user id, `sub` claim in JWT, etc). 

Since the Router does not know in advance if a particular query will return private data, it implements the following sequence:
- the first time it sees a query, it requests the cache as if it was a public only query
- when the subgraph returns the response with private data, it recognizes it and stores the data in a user specific part of the cache
- it stores the query in a list of know queries with private data
- the next time the query comes in:
  - if the private id is not provided, it does not interrogate the cache and instead, transmit the subgraph response directly
  - if the private id is provided, it queries the part of the cache for the current user, and checks the subgraph if nothing is available

### Observability

We added a new [selector](./telemetry/instrumentation/selectors#subgraph) in telemetry at the subgraph service called `cache` which returns the number of cache hit or miss we had by entity for a subgraph request.

## Spans

For example you could add a new attribute on the subgraph span to know how many cache hit we had:

```yaml title="todo_router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      subgraph:
        attributes:
          cache.hit:
            cache: hit
```

## Metrics

We're providing a new section in `telemetry.instrumentation.instruments` to enable cache metrics:

```yaml title="todo_router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    instruments:
      cache: # Cache instruments configuration
        http.client.request.cache: # A counter which counts the number of cache hit and miss for subgraph requests
          attributes:
            entity.type: true # Include the entity type name. default: false
            subgraph.name: # Custom attributes to include the subgraph name in the metric
              subgraph_name: true
            supergraph.operation.name: # Add custom attribute to display the supergraph operation name
              supergraph_operation_name: string
            # You can add more custom attributes using subgraph selectors
```

But you can also create you own metrics using custom instruments at the subgraph service.
For example, here we create a custom instrument to generate an histogram measuring the subgraph request duration when we have at least 1 cache hit but only for subgraph "inventory":

```yaml title="todo_router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    instruments:
      subgraph:
        only_cache_hit_on_subgraph_inventory:
          type: histogram
          value: duration
          unit: hit
          description: histogram of subgraph request duration when we have cache hit on subgraph inventory
          condition:
            all:
            - eq:
              - subgraph_name: true # subgraph selector
              - inventory
            - gt: # If the number of cache hit is greater than 0
              - cache: hit
              # entity_type: Product # Here you could also only check for the entity type Product, it's `all` by default if we don't specify this config.
              - 0

```


## Implementation notes

### Cache-Control header requirement

The Router currently cannot know which types or fields should be cached, so it requires the subgraph to set a `Cache-Control` header in its response to indicate that it should be stored.

### Responses with errors not cached

To prevent transient errors from affecting the cache for a long duration, subgraph responses with errors are not cached.

### Authorization and entity caching

When used alongside the router's [authorization directives](./authorization), cache entries are separated by authorization context. If a query contains fields that need a specific scope, the requests providing that scope have different cache entries from those not providing the scope. This means that data requiring authorization can still be safely cached and even shared across users, without needing invalidation when a user's roles change because their requests are automatically directed to a different part of the cache.

### Schema updates and entity caching

On schema updates, the router ensures that queries unaffected by the changes keep their cache entries. Queries with affected fields need to be cached again to ensure the router doesn't serve invalid data from before the update.

### Entity cache invalidation not supported

Cache invalidation is not yet supported and is planned for a future release.
