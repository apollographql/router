Running an Apollo Router instance involves some key steps:
- Getting the schema of the federated supergraph that your router is running
- Configuring runtime features declaratively in YAML
- Deploying to different environments (dev, prod, etc.)
- Providing configuration command-line options, YAML, and environment variables at startup

## Getting supergraph schema

As the runtime for a federated graph, a router needs to know the schema of the graph it's running. We call the schema for a federated graph a _supergraph schema_. 

You need to configure the router at startup to know where to get its supergraph schema. That configuration depends on whether or not its supergraph schema is managed by GraphOS:

- If your supergraph schema is managed by GraphOS, you can configure your router with the GraphOS graph ref and API key as environment variables (`APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` and `APOLLO_KEY`). Based on these, the router can automatically fetch the supergraph schema from GraphOS.
- Otherwise, you can provide the router a supergraph schema file [via command line or environment variable](/graphos/routing/configuration/cli#-s----supergraph).

## Configuring features in YAML

Configuring the router's features happens primarily via a YAML configuration file. Named `router.yaml` by default, the router's YAML configuration file lets you configure all of a router's runtime features declaratively. 

## Passing configuration at startup

Command-line options, a YAML config, and environment variables are passed to the router at startup. 

This example command would be for a router with a GraphOS-managed graph and a custom named `myrouter.yaml` config file:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
APOLLO_KEY="..." APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="..." router --config myrouter.yaml
```

> The router can hot-reload updated configuration. When enabled, changes in `router.yaml` trigger the router to restart with its updated configuration.
