The Apollo Router provides built-in logging to capture records about the router's activity.

The router supports [configurable log levels](#log-level) and [stdout output](./stdout) of log  messages (with [configurable output formats](./stdout/#logging-output-format)).

## Log level

The Apollo Router accepts a command-line argument to set its log level:

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `--log`

</td>
<td>

The log level, indicating the _most_ severe log message type to include. In ascending order of verbosity, can be one of: `off`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace`.

The default value is `info`.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

The router also accepts both `RUST_LOG` and `APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG` environment variables with the same possible values as the command-line argument. With multiple ways to set the log level, the router checks for them in the following order, and it uses the first one that is set:

 1. `RUST_LOG`
 1. Command-line argument
 1. `APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG`

`RUST_LOG` is supported for advanced users with specific filtering requirements who may wish to see log messages from crates consumed by the router. Most users should use the command-line argument or `APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG`. Both of these options constrain log output to the router.

For example, every environment variable and command-line argument below sets the log level to `debug`:

```
RUST_LOG=apollo_router::debug
APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG=debug
--log=debug
```

For another example, every line below sets the same log levels:

```
RUST_LOG=hyper=debug,apollo_router::info,h2=trace
APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG=hyper=debug,info,h2=trace
--log=hyper=debug,info,h2=trace
```

In both examples, the actual filter used by the router the value defined by `RUST_LOG`.

For more information about specifying filters for more granular control over Apollo Router logging, see the [Env Logger documentation](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/).


## Logging common configuration

The router supports configuration options that apply to all logging exporters:

* [Service name](#service-name)
* [Resource attributes](#resource)

### Service name

Set a service name for your router's logs so they can be easily searched and found in your metrics dashboards. 

The service name can be set by an environment variable or in `router.yaml`. With multiple ways to set the service name, the router checks for them in the following order, and it uses the first one that is set:

1. `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable
2. `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable
3. `telemetry.exporters.logging.common.service_name` in `router.yaml`

      <ExpansionPanel title="Example service_name">

      Example setting service name in `telemetry.exporters.logging.common.service_name`:

      ```yaml title="router.yaml"
      telemetry:
        exporters:
          logging:
            common:
              # (Optional) Set the service name to easily find logs related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
              service_name: "router" #highlight-line
      ```

      </ExpansionPanel>


4. `telemetry.exporters.logging.common.resource` in `router.yaml`

      <ExpansionPanel title="Example resource">

      Example setting service name in `telemetry.exporters.logging.common.resource`:

      ```yaml title="router.yaml"
      telemetry:
        exporters:
          logging:
            common:
              resource:
                # (Optional) Set the service name to easily find logs related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
                "service.name": "router" #highlight-line
      ```

      </ExpansionPanel>

If the service name isn't explicitly set, then it is set by default to `unknown_service:apollo_router` (or `unknown_service` if the executable name cannot be determined).

### Resource attribute

A resource attribute is a set of key-value pairs that provide additional information to an exporter. Application performance monitors (APM) may interpret and display resource information. 

In `router.yaml`, resource attributes are set in `telemetry.exporters.logging.common.resource`. For example:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
     logging:
       common:
         resource:
           "environment.name": "production"
           "environment.namespace": "{env.MY_K8_NAMESPACE_ENV_VARIABLE}"
```

For OpenTelemetry conventions for resources, see [Resource Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/resource/README.md).

### Request/Response logging

<ExperimentalFeature appendText="If you want to give feedback or participate in the feature, feel free to join [the discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/1961)." />


By default, the router _doesn't_ log the following values that might contain sensitive data, even if a sufficient log level is set:

 - Request bodies
 - Response bodies
 - Headers 

You can enable selective logging of these values via the `experimental_when_header` option:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    logging:
      # If one of these headers matches we will log supergraph and subgraphs requests/responses
      experimental_when_header:
        - name: apollo-router-log-request
          value: my_client
          headers: true # default: false
          body: true # default: false
        # log request for all requests coming from Iphones
        - name: user-agent
          match: ^Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone*
          headers: true
```

## Experimental logging of broken pipe errors

You can emit a log message each time the client closes the connection early, which can help you debug issues with clients that close connections before the server can respond. 

This feature is disabled by default but can be enabled by setting the `experimental_log_broken_pipe` option to `true`:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
   experimental_log_on_broken_pipe: true
```
| Attribute                        | Default | Description                                         |
|----------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `experimental_log_on_broken_pipe`   | false   | Emit a log message if a broken pipe was detected.   |
