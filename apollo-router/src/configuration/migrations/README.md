# Configuration migrations
This directory contains configuration migrations that can be applied to a router to a router config to bring it up to date with current config format.

It uses [proteus](https://github.com/rust-playground/proteus) under the hood, which handles the complexities of merging Json.

A migration has the following format:

The filename should begin with a 4 digit numerical prefix. This allows us to apply migrations in a deterministic order.
`Filename: 0001-name.yaml`

The yaml consists of a description and a number of actions:
```yaml
description: telemetry.tracing.common.attributes.router has been renamed to 'supergraph' for consistency
actions:
  - type: move
    from: some.source
    to: some.destination
  - type: copy
    from: some.source
    to: some.destination
  - type: delete
    path: some.destination
  - type: add
    path: some.destination
    value: someValue
```

Each action is applied in order. Use the following formats for from, to and path.

## Getter (from)
| syntax | description |
---------|-------------|
| | this will grab the top-level value which could be any valid type: Object, array, ... |
| id | Gets a JSON Object's name. eg. key in HashMap |
| [0] | Gets a JSON Arrays index at the specified index. |
| profile.first_name | Combine Object names with dot notation. |
| profile.address[0].street | Combinations using dot notation and indexes is also supported. |

## Setter (to, path)
| syntax | description |
---------|-------------|
| | this will set the top-level value in the destination |
| id | By itself any text is considered to be a JSON Object's name. |
| [] | This appends the source **data** to an array, creating it if it doesn't exist and is only valid at the end of set syntax eg. profile.address[] |
| [\+] | The source Array should append all of it's values into the destination Array and is only valid at the end of set syntax eg. profile.address[] |
| [\-] | The source Array values should replace the destination Array's values at the overlapping indexes and is only valid at the end of set syntax eg. profile.address[] |
| {} | This merges the supplied Object overtop of the existing and is only valid at the end of set syntax eg. profile{} |
| profile.first_name | Combine Object names with dot notation. |
| profile.address[0].street | Combinations using dot notation and indexes is also supported. |

See [proteus](https://github.com/rust-playground/proteus) for more options.

If a migration is deemed to have changed the configuration then the description of the migration will be output to the user as a warning.

In future we will be able to use these files to support offline migrations.

# Testing
Once you have made a new migration place a config file in `testdata/migrations`. It will automatically be picked up by the `upgrade_old_configuration` test.
