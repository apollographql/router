Learn how to deploy the router on Railway's managed hosting platform.

You will:
- Deploy using the Apollo Router template for quick setup
- Configure environment variables and deployment settings
- Customize your deployment with advanced configuration options

## Prerequisites

Before you start:

1. [Set up a GraphQL API in GraphOS](/graphos/get-started/guides/graphql#step-1-set-up-your-graphql-api).
    - Save your `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`. You'll need them when deploying the router.
1. Create a [Railway account](https://railway.com/) or use an existing account.
1. Have a GitHub account (for template deployment or custom repository setup).

## Option 1: Quick deployment with template (Recommended)

The fastest way to deploy the Apollo Router on Railway is using the official template:

1. Deploy the template:
   - Click  [![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/apollo-router)

2. Configure your deployment:
   - Template Name: Enter a name for your deployment (e.g., `my-apollo-router`)
   - Repository Name: Choose a name for the forked repository

3. Set environment variables:
   - `APOLLO_KEY`: Your Graph API key from GraphOS Studio
   - `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`: Your graph reference (e.g., `my-graph@production`)
   - Railway automatically sets the `PORT` variable to the correct value

4. Deploy: Click **Deploy** to start the deployment.

5. Verify deployment: After the deployment finishes, visit your service URL to confirm the router is running. Railway provides a public URL for your service.

## Option 2: Custom deployment

If you need more control over your deployment, you can set up a custom deployment using the Apollo Runtime container image:

### Using Apollo Runtime container image

The Apollo Runtime container image provides a production-ready router with sensible defaults, eliminating the need for complex configuration in most cases.

1. Fork the [router-template](https://github.com/apollographql/router-template) repository.

2. (Optional) Create a `router.yaml` configuration file for custom settings:
    
    ```yaml title="router.yaml"
    # The Apollo Runtime container comes with sensible defaults
    # Only create this file if you need custom configuration
    supergraph:
        listen: 0.0.0.0:4000
    health_check:
        listen: 0.0.0.0:8088
    cors:
      # Development setting - replace for production
      allow_any_origin: true
    ```

3. Create a `Dockerfile`:

    ```dockerfile
    # Use the official Apollo Runtime container image as the base
    FROM ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-runtime:0.0.14_router2.5.0_mcp-server0.7.0

    # Optionally copy custom router configuration
    # COPY router.yaml /config/router_config.yaml
    ```

### Deploy to Railway

1. Connect your repository:
   - In your Railway dashboard, click **New Project**
   - Select **Deploy from GitHub repo**
   - Connect and authorize your GitHub repository

2. Railway automatically configures the service:
   - Railway detects your Dockerfile and configures the service
   - The build and deployment process starts automatically

3. Set environment variables:
   - In your project dashboard, go to the **Variables** tab
   - Add `APOLLO_KEY` and set it to your Graph API key
   - Add `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` and set it to your graph reference
   - Railway automatically provides the `PORT` variable

4. Automatic deployment: Railway automatically redeploys your service when environment variables are added

## Apollo MCP Server

The Apollo Runtime container includes an optional MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI assistants with structured access to your GraphQL schema and operations.

### Enable the MCP Server

The MCP server is disabled by default. To enable it, set the `MCP_ENABLE` environment variable to `1`:

In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your service's **Variables** tab
2. Add `MCP_ENABLE` with value `1`
3. Railway will automatically redeploy your service
