Apollo provides container images of the Apollo Router. By containerizing the router, you can run it in a cluster and leverage the portability, scalability, and high availability benefits of containerization. Containers can also simplify and speed up local development.

## About the Apollo Router container image

Apollo provides container images of the Apollo Router [on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/router) in its container repository. The router images are based on [debian:bullseye-slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/), which is designed to provide constrained, secure, and small images.

Each release of the Apollo Router includes both default (production) and debug images. While each image for a release contains the same build, the debug images have helpful debugging utilities installed and run the router under the control of [heaptrack](https://github.com/KDE/heaptrack).

A router image has the following layout:

* A `/dist` directory containing the router executable and licensing details
* A `dist/config` directory containing a default configuration file, `router.yaml`
* A `/dist/schema` directory for conveniently mounting a locally defined supergraph schema

## Next steps

The default behavior of a router image is suitable for a basic deployment or development scenario.

For examples of customizing and deploying router images in specific environments, see the guides for: 
* [Deploying in Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).
* [Running in Docker](./docker/)
