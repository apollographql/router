# [0.10.1] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd
## ❗ BREAKING ❗

### Relax plugin api mutability ([PR #1340](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1340) ([PR #1289](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1289)

the `Plugin::*_service()` methods were taking a `&mut self` as argument, but since
they work like a tower Layer, they can use `&self` instead. This change
then allows us to move from Buffer to service factories for the query
planner, execution and subgraph services

### Replace Buffers of tower services with service factories([PR #1289](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1289) [PR #1355](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1355))

tower services should be used by creating a new service instance for each new session
instead of going through a Buffer.
