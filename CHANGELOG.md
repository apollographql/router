# [1.10.2] - 2023-02-08

## üêõ Fixes

### Resolve incorrect nullification when using `@interfaceObject` with particular response objects ([PR #2530](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2530))

> Note: This follows up on the v1.10.1 release which also attempted to fix this, but inadvertently excluded a required part of the fix due to an administrative oversight.

The Federation 2.3.x `@interfaceObject` feature implies that an interface type in the supergraph may be locally handled as an object type by some specific subgraphs.  Therefore, such subgraphs may return objects whose `__typename` is the interface type in their response. In some cases, those `__typename` were leading the Router to unexpectedly and incorrectly nullify the underlying objects.  This was not caught in the initial integration of Federation 2.3.

### Refactor Uplink implementation ([Issue #2547](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2547))

The Apollo Uplink implementation within Apollo Router, which is used for fetching data _from_ Apollo GraphOS, has been decomposed into a reusable component so that it can be used more generically for fetching artifacts.  This generally improved code quality and resulted in several new tests being added.

Additionally, our round-robin fetching behaviour is now more durable. Previously, on failure, there would be a delay before trying the next round-robin URL. Now, all URLs will be tried in sequence until exhausted. If ultimately all URLs fail, then the usual delay is applied before trying again.

### Improve Changelog management through conventions and tooling ([PR #2545](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2545), [PR #2534](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2534))

New tooling and conventions adjust our "incoming changelog in the next release" mechanism to no longer rely on a single file, but instead leverage a "file per feature" pattern in conjunction with tooling to create that file.

This stubbing takes place through the use of a new command:

    cargo xtask changeset create

# [1.10.1] - 2023-02-07

## üêõ Fixes

### Federation v2.3.1 ([Issue #2556](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2556))

Update to [Federation v2.3.1](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/main/query-planner-js/CHANGELOG.md#231) to fix subtle bug in `@interfaceObject`.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Redis integration tests ([Issue #2174](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2174))

We now have integration tests for Redis usage with Automatic Persisted Queries and query planning.

### CI: Enable compliance checks _except_ `licenses.html` update ([Issue #2514](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2514))

In [#1573](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1573), we removed the compliance checks for non-release CI pipelines, because `cargo-about` output would change ever so slightly on each run.

While many of the checks provided by the compliance check are license related, some checks prevent us from inadvertently downgrading libraries and needing to open, e.g., [Issue #2512](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2512).

This set of changes includes the following:
- Introduce `cargo xtask licenses` to update licenses.html.
- Separate compliance (`cargo-deny`, which includes license checks) and licenses generation (`cargo-about`) in `xtask`
- Enable compliance as part of our CI checks for each open PR
- Update `cargo xtask all` so it runs tests, checks compliance and updates `licenses.html`
- Introduce `cargo xtask dev` so it checks compliance and runs tests

Going forward, when developing on the Router source:

- Use `cargo xtask all`  to make sure everything is up to date before a release.
- Use `cargo xtask dev` before a PR.

As a last note, updating `licenses.html` is now driven by `cargo xtask licenses`, which is part of the release checklist and automated through our release tooling in `xtask`.

### Fix flaky tracing integration test ([Issue #2548](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2548))

Disable federated-tracing (FTV1) in tests by lowering the sampling rate to zero so that consistent results are generated in test snapshots.

By [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2549

### Update to Rust 1.67

We've updated the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) version to v1.67.

# [1.10.0] - 2023-02-01

## üöÄ Features

### Update to Federation v2.3.0 ([Issue #2465](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2465), [Issue #2485](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2485) and [Issue #2489](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2489))

This brings in Federation v2.3.0 execution support for:
- `@interfaceObject` (added to federation in [federation#2277](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/issues/2277)).
- the bug fix from [federation#2294](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/2294).

By [@pcmanus](https://github.com/pcmanus) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2485 and https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2489

### Always deduplicate variables on subgraph entity fetches ([Issue #2387](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2387))

Variable deduplication allows the router to reduce the number of entities that are requested from subgraphs if some of them are redundant, and as such reduce the size of subgraph responses. It has been available for a while but was not active by default. This is now always on.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2445

### Add optional `Access-Control-Max-Age` header to CORS plugin ([Issue #2212](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2212))

Adds new option called `max_age` to the existing `cors` object which will set the value returned in the [`Access-Control-Max-Age`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Max-Age) header. As was the case previously, when this value is not set **no** value is returned.

It can be enabled using our standard time notation, as follows:

```
cors:
  max_age: 1day
```

By [@osamra-rbi](https://github.com/osamra-rbi) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2331

### Improved support for wildcards in `supergraph.path` configuration ([Issue #2406](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2406))

You can now use a wildcard in supergraph endpoint `path` like this:

```yaml
supergraph:
  listen: 0.0.0.0:4000
  path: /graph*
```

In this example, the Router would respond to requests on both `/graphql` and `/graphiql`.

## üêõ Fixes

### Forbid caching `PERSISTED_QUERY_NOT_FOUND` responses ([Issue #2502](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2502))

The router now sends a `cache-control: private, no-cache, must-revalidate` response header to clients, in addition to the existing `PERSISTED_QUERY_NOT_FOUND` error code on the response which was being sent previously.  This expanded behaviour occurs when a persisted query hash could not be found and is important since such responses should **not** be cached by intermediary proxies/CDNs since the client will need to be able to send the full query directly to the Router on a subsequent request.

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2503
### Listen on root URL when `/*` is set in `supergraph.path` configuration ([Issue #2471](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2471))

This resolves a regression which occurred in Router 1.8 when using wildcard notation on a path-boundary, as such:

```yaml
supergraph:
  path: /*
```

This occurred due to an underlying [Axum upgrade](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/releases/tag/axum-v0.6.0) and resulted in failure to listen on `localhost` when a path was absent. We now special case `/*` to also listen to the URL without a path so you're able to call `http://localhost` (for example).

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2472

### Subgraph traffic shaping timeouts now return HTTP 504 status code ([Issue #2360](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2360) [Issue #2400](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/240))

There was a regression where timeouts resulted in a HTTP response of `500 Internal Server Error`. This is now fixed with a test to guarantee it, the status code is now `504 Gateway Timeout` (instead of the previous `408 Request Timeout` which, was also incorrect in that it blamed the client).

There is also a new metric emitted called `apollo_router_timeout` to track when timeouts are triggered.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2419

### Fix panic in schema parse error reporting ([Issue #2269](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2269))

In order to support introspection, some definitions like `type __Field { ‚Ä¶ }` are implicitly added to schemas. This addition was done by string concatenation at the source level. In some cases, like unclosed braces, a parse error could be reported at a position beyond the size of the original source. This would cause a panic because only the unconcatenated string is sent to the error reporting library `miette`.

Instead, the Router now parses introspection types separately and "concatenates" the definitions at the AST level.

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2448

### Always accept compressed subgraph responses  ([Issue #2415](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2415))

Previously, subgraph response decompression was only supported when subgraph request compression was _explicitly_ configured. This is now always active.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2450

### Fix handling of root query operations not named `Query`

If you'd mapped your default `Query` type to something other than the default using `schema { query: OtherQuery }`, some parsing code in the Router would incorrectly return an error because it had previously assumed the default name of `Query`. The same case would have occurred if the root mutation type was not named `Mutation`.

This is now corrected and the Router understands the mapping.

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2459

### Remove the `locations` field from subgraph errors ([Issue #2297](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2297))

Subgraph errors can come with a `locations` field indicating which part of the query was causing issues, but it refers to the subgraph query generated by the query planner, and we have no way of translating it to locations in the client query. To avoid confusion, we've removed this field from the response until we can provide a more coherent way to map these errors back to the original operation.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2442

### Emit metrics showing number of client connections ([issue #2384](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2384))

New metrics are available to track the client connections:

- `apollo_router_session_count_total` indicates the number of currently connected clients
- `apollo_router_session_count_active` indicates the number of in flight GraphQL requests from connected clients.

This also fixes the behaviour when we reach the maximum number of file descriptors: instead of going into a busy loop, the router will wait a bit before accepting a new connection.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2395

### `--dev` will no longer modify configuration that it does not directly touch ([Issue #2404](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2404), [Issue #2481](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2481))

Previously, the Router's `--dev` mode was operating against the configuration object model. This meant that it would sometimes replace pieces of configuration where it should have merely modified it.  Now, `--dev` mode will _override_ the following properties in the YAML config, but it will leave any adjacent configuration as it was:

```yaml
homepage:
  enabled: false
include_subgraph_errors:
  all: true
plugins:
  experimental.expose_query_plan: true
sandbox:
  enabled: true
supergraph:
  introspection: true
telemetry:
  tracing:
    experimental_response_trace_id:
      enabled: true
```

## üõ† Maintenance

### Improve `#[serde(default)]` attribute on structs ([Issue #2424](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2424))

If all the fields of your `struct` have their default value then use the `#[serde(default)]` on the `struct` instead of on each field. If you have specific default values for a field, you'll have to create your own `impl Default` for the `struct`.

#### Correct approach

```rust
#[serde(deny_unknown_fields, default)]
struct Export {
    url: Url,
    enabled: bool
}

impl Default for Export {
  fn default() -> Self {
    Self {
      url: default_url_fn(),
      enabled: false
    }
  }
}
```

#### Discouraged approach

```rust
#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]
struct Export {
    #[serde(default="default_url_fn")
    url: Url,
    #[serde(default)]
    enabled: bool
}
```

## üìÉ Configuration

Configuration changes will be [automatically migrated on load](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview#upgrading-your-router-configuration). However, you should update your source configuration files as these will become breaking changes in a future major release.

### `health-check` has been renamed to `health_check` ([Issue #2161](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2161))

The `health_check` option in the configuration has been renamed to use `snake_case` rather than `kebab-case` for consistency with the other properties in the configuration:

```diff
-health-check:
+health_check:
   enabled: true
```

## üìö Documentation

### Disabling anonymous usage metrics ([Issue #2478](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2478))

To disable the anonymous usage metrics, you set `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` in the environment.  The documentation previously said to use `1` as the value instead of `true`.  In the future, either will work, so this is primarily a bandaid for the immediate error.

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2479

### `send_headers` and `send_variable_values` in `telemetry.apollo` ([Issue #2149](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2149))

+ `send_headers`

  Provide this field to configure which request header names and values are included in trace data that's sent to Apollo Studio. Valid options are: `only` with an array, `except` with an array, `none`, `all`.

  The default value is `none``, which means no header names or values are sent to Studio. This is a security measure to prevent sensitive data from potentially reaching the Router.

+ `send_variable_values`

  Provide this field to configure which variable values are included in trace data that's sent to Apollo Studio. Valid options are: `only` with an array, `except` with an array, `none`, `all`.

  The default value is `none`, which means no variable values are sent to Studio. This is a security measure to prevent sensitive data from potentially reaching the Router.

### Propagating headers between subgraphs ([Issue #2128](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2128))

Passing headers between subgraph services is possible via Rhai script and we've added an example to the [header propagation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/header-propagation) documentation.

By [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2446

### Propagating response headers to clients ([Issue #1284](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1284))

Passing headers from subgraph services to clients is possible via Rhai script and we've added an example to the [header propagation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/header-propagation) documentation.

### IPv6 listening instructions ([Issue #1835](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1835))

Added instructions for how to represent IPv6 listening addresses to our [Overview](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview) documentation.

```yaml
supergraph:
  # The socket address and port to listen on.
  # Note that this must be quoted to avoid interpretation as a yaml array.
  listen: '[::1]:4000'
```

## üõ† Maintenance

### Parse schemas and queries with `apollo-compiler`

The Router now uses the higher-level representation (HIR) from `apollo-compiler` instead of using the AST from `apollo-parser` directly.  This is a first step towards replacing a bunch of code that grew organically during the Router's early days, with a general-purpose library with intentional design.  Internal data structures are unchanged for now.  Parsing behavior has been tested to be identical on a large corpus of schemas and queries.

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2466

### Disregard value of `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` in Orbiter unit tests ([Issue #2487](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2487))

The `orbiter::test::test_visit_args` tests were failing in the event that `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` was set, however this is now corrected.

## ü•º Experimental

### JWT authentication ([Issue #912](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/912))

As a result of UX feedback, we are modifying the experimental JWT configuration. The `jwks_url` parameter is renamed to `jwks_urls` and now expects to receive an array of URLs, rather than a single URL.

We've updated the [JWT Authentication documentation](apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/authn-jwt) accordingly, however here's a short sample configuration example:

```yaml
authentication:
  experimental:
    jwt:
      jwks_urls:
        - https://dev-abcd1234.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json
```

# [1.9.0] - 2023-01-20

## üöÄ Features

### Add support for `base64::encode()` / `base64::decode()` in Rhai ([Issue #2025](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2025))

Two new functions, `base64::encode()` and `base64::decode()`, have been added to the capabilities available within Rhai scripts to Base64-encode or Base64-decode strings, respectively.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2394

### Override the root TLS certificate list for subgraph requests ([Issue #1503](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1503))

In some cases, users need to use self-signed certificates or use a custom certificate authority (CA) when communicating with subgraphs.

It is now possible to consigure these certificate-related details using configuration for either specific subgraphs or all subgraphs, as follows:

```yaml
tls:
  subgraph:
    all:
      certificate_authorities: "${file./path/to/ca.crt}"
    # Use a separate certificate for the `products` subgraph.
    subgraphs:
      products:
        certificate_authorities: "${file./path/to/product_ca.crt}"
```

The file referenced in the `certificate_authorities` value is expected to be the combination of several PEM certificates, concatenated together into a single file (as is commonplace with Apache TLS configuration).

These certificates are only configurable via the Router's configuration since using `SSL_CERT_FILE` would also override certificates for sending telemetry and communicating with Apollo Uplink.

While we do not currently support terminating TLS at the Router (from clients), the `tls` is located at the root of the configuration file to allow all TLS-related configuration to be semantically grouped together in the future.

Note: If you are attempting to use a self-signed certificate, it must be generated with the proper file extension and with `basicConstraints` disabled.  For example, a `v3.ext` extension file:

```
subjectKeyIdentifier   = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer:always
# this has to be disabled
# basicConstraints       = CA:TRUE
keyUsage               = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment, keyAgreement, keyCertSign
subjectAltName         = DNS:local.apollo.dev
issuerAltName          = issuer:copy
```

Using this `v3.ext` file, the certificate can be generated with the appropriate certificate signing request (CSR) - in this example, `server.csr` - using the following `openssl` command:

```
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt -extfile v3.ext
```

This will produce the file as `server.crt` which can be passed as `certificate_authorities`.

### Measure the Router's processing time ([Issue #1949](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1949) [Issue #2057](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2057))

The Router now emits a metric called `apollo_router_processing_time` which measures the time spent executing the request **minus** the time spent waiting for an external requests (e.g., subgraph request/response or external plugin request/response).  This measurement accounts both for the time spent actually executing the request as well as the time spent waiting for concurrent client requests to be executed.  The unit of measurement for the metric is in seconds, as with other time-related metrics the router produces, though this is not meant to indicate in any way that the Router is going to add actual seconds of overhead.

### Automated persisted queries support for subgraph requests ([PR #2284](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2284))

Automatic persisted queries (APQ) (See useful context [in our Apollo Server docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/)) can now be used for subgraph requests. It is disabled by default, and can be configured for all subgraphs or per subgraph:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
  apq:
    subgraph:
      # override for all subgraphs
      all:
        enabled: false
      # override per subgraph
      subgraphs:
        products:
          enabled: true
```

### Allow the disabling of automated persisted queries ([PR #2386](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2386))

Automatic persisted queries (APQ) support is still enabled by default on the client side, but can now be disabled in the configuration:

```yaml
supergraph:
  apq:
    enabled: false
```

### Anonymous product usage analytics ([Issue #2124](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2124), [Issue #2397](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2397), [Issue #2412](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2412))

Following up on https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1630, the Router transmits anonymous usage telemetry about configurable feature usage which helps guide Router product development. No information is transmitted in our usage collection that includes any request-specific information. Knowing what features and configuration our users are depending on allows us to evaluate opportunities to reduce complexity and remain diligent about the surface area of the Router over time. The privacy of your and your user's data is of critical importance to the core Router team and we handle it with great care in accordance with our [privacy policy](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/privacy/), which clearly states which data we collect and transmit and offers information on how to opt-out.

Booleans and numeric values are included, however, any strings are represented as `<redacted>` to avoid leaking confidential or sensitive information.

For example:
```json5
{
   "session_id": "fbe09da3-ebdb-4863-8086-feb97464b8d7", // Randomly generated at Router startup.
   "version": "1.4.0", // The version of the router
   "os": "linux",
   "ci": null, // If CI is detected then this will name the CI vendor
   "usage": {
     "configuration.headers.all.request.propagate.named.<redacted>": 3,

### Don't send header names to Studio if `send_headers` is `none` ([Issue #2403](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2403))

We no longer transmit header **names** to Apollo Studio when `send_headers` is set to `none` (the default).  Previously, when `send_headers` was set to `none` (like in the following example) the header names were still transmitted with _empty_ header values.   No actual values were ever being sent unless `send_headers` was sent to a more permissive option like `forward_headers_only` or `forward_headers_except`.

telemetry:
  apollo:
    send_headers: none

### Fix `APOLLO_USAGE_REPORTING_INGRESS_URL` behavior when Router was run without a configuration file

The environment variable `APOLLO_USAGE_REPORTING_INGRESS_URL` (not usually necessary under typical operation) was **not** being applied correctly when the Router was run without a configuration file.
In addition, defaulting of environment variables now directly injects the variable rather than injecting via expansion expression.  This means that the use of `APOLLO_ROUTER_CONFIG_ENV_PREFIX` (even less common) doesn't affect injected configuration defaults.

### Creating custom metrics in plugins ([Issue #2294](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2294))

To create your custom metrics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) you can use the [`tracing` macros](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/index.html#macros) to generate an event. If you observe a specific naming pattern for your event, you'll be able to generate your own custom metrics directly in Prometheus.

To publish a new metric, use tracing macros to generate an event that contains one of the following prefixes:

`monotonic_counter.` _(non-negative numbers)_: Used when the metric will only ever increase.
`counter.`: For when the metric may increase or decrease over time.
`value.`: For discrete data points (i.e., when taking the sum of values does not make semantic sense)
`histogram.`: For building histograms (takes `f64`)

This information is also available in [the Apollo Router documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/native#add-custom-metrics).

### Emit hit/miss metrics for APQ, Query Planning and Introspection caches ([Issue #1985](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1985))

Added metrics for caching.
Each cache metric contains a `kind` attribute to indicate the kind of cache (`query planner`, `apq`, `introspection`)
and a `storage` attribute to indicate the backing storage e.g memory/disk.

The following buckets are exposed:
`apollo_router_cache_hit_count` - cache hits.

`apollo_router_cache_miss_count` - cache misses.

`apollo_router_cache_hit_time` - cache hit duration.

`apollo_router_cache_miss_time` - cache miss duration.

### Query plan cache is pre-warmed using existing operations when the supergraph changes ([Issue #2302](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2302), [Issue #2308](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2308))

A new `warmed_up_queries` configuration option has been introduced to pre-warm the query plan cache when the supergraph changes.

Under normal operation, query plans are cached to avoid the recomputation cost.  However, when the supergraph changes, previously-planned queries must be re-planned to account for implementation changes in the supergraph, even though the query itself may not have changed.  Under load, this re-planning can cause performance variations due to the extra computation work.  To reduce the impact, it is now possible to pre-warm the query plan cache for the incoming supergraph, prior to changing over to the new supergraph.  Pre-warming slightly delays the roll-over to the incoming supergraph, but allows the most-requested operations to not be impacted by the additional computation work.

To enable pre-warming, the following configuration can be introduced which sets `warmed_up_queries`:

```yaml
supergraph:
  query_planning:
    # Pre-plan the 100 most used operations when the supergraph changes.  (Default is "0", disabled.)
    warmed_up_queries: 100
    experimental_cache:
      in_memory:
        # Sets the limit of entries in the query plan cache
        limit: 512
```

Query planning was also updated to finish executing and setting up the cache, even if the response couldn't be returned to the client which is important to avoid throwing away computationally-expensive work.

This change saves build time for developers.

### Return an error on duplicate keys in configuration ([Issue #1428](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1428))

Repeat usage of the same keys in Router YAML can be hard to notice but indicate a misconfiguration which can cause unexpected behavior since only one of the values can be in effect.  With this improvement, the following YAML configuration will raise an error at Router startup to alert the user of the misconfiguration:

```yaml
telemetry:
  tracing:
    propagation:
      jaeger: true
  tracing:
    propagation:
      jaeger: false

In this particular example, the error produced would be:

The special-case `__typename` field is no longer being treated incorrectly when requested at the root level on an operation which used `@defer`.  For example, the following query:

```graphql
{
  __typename
  ...deferedFragment @defer
}

fragment deferedFragment on Query {
  slow
}
```

The Router now exhibits the correct behavior for this query with `__typename` being returned as soon as possible in the initial chunk, as follows:

This more aggressive change has been taken on account of continued reports of failed hot-reloading and follows up our previous replacement of [`hotwatch`](https://crates.io/crates/hotwatch).  We don't have very demanding file watching requirements, so while `PollWatcher` offers less sophisticated functionality and _slightly_ slower reactivity, it is at least consistent on all platforms and should provide the best developer experience.

### Preserve subgraph error's `path` property when redacting subgraph errors ([Issue #1818](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1818))

The `path` property in errors is now preserved.  Previously, error redaction was removing the error's `path` property, which made debugging difficult but also made it impossible to correctly match errors from deferred responses to the appropriate fields in the requested operation.  Since the response shape for the primary and deferred responses are defined from the client-facing "API schema", rather than the supergraph, this change will not result in leaking internal supergraph implementation details to clients and the result will be consistent, even if the subgraph which provides a particular field changes over time.

Previously, _all_ '+' characters were being replaced with spaces which broke cases where the `+` symbol was not merely an encoding symbol (e.g., ISO8601 date time values with timezone information).

### Introduce a `router_service` layer ([Issue #1496](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1496))

A `router_service` layer is now part of our service stack and allows plugin developers to process raw HTTP requests and responses from clients prior to those requests reaching the GraphQL processing within the `supergraph_service` layer.  This will become a stable part of our API as we receive feedback from its early adopters.  Please open a discussion with any feedback you might have!

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2170

### Request pipeline customization via HTTP ([Issue #1916](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1916))

We now offer the ability to configure some aspects of the Router via the response to an HTTP `POST` request to an external endpoint.  Initially, we are only offering this option to customize the newly introduced `router_service` (above, in these release notes), but our intention is to introduce customization of [existing service layers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/overview/#how-customizations-work) as well (e.g., `supergraph_service, `subgraph_service`, etc.).  Conceptually, this addition allows similar customizations that are possible with Rhai or Rust plugin by sending the operation's context as of a particular phase of the request pipeline "over the wire" as of a particular to an external HTTP service which has the ability to process its properties and return a (potentially) modified response to the Router.  This will become a stable part of our API as we receive feedback from its early adopters.  Please open a discussion with any feedback you might have!

When this experimental option is enabled, contextual data will be transmitted as a JSON payload to an HTTP endpoint as a `POST` request.  The response to such a request will be processed by the Router and any changes made by the external service will effect the remaining layers in the request pipeline.  This allows external services to customize the  Router behavior, but requires intentionally blocking Router's normal request pipeline.  Therefore, any latency of a configured external service will have a direct impact on the performance of the Router and external services should be as performant as possible.

To experiement with this behavior, consider adopting a configuration similar to the following which communicates with a service running on `http://127.0.0.1:8081` for the `router` service layer:

```yaml
plugins:
  experimental.external:
    # A URL which will be called for each request for any configured stage.
    url: http://127.0.0.1:8081

    # A human-readable interval specifying the maximum allowed time. (Defaults to "1s", or one second)
    timeout: 2s

    # A "stage" represents a phase of the request pipeline in which the external service will be invoked.
    # They sit request pipeline as our Service Layers for Rust/Rhai, seen in our docs:
    #   https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/overview/#how-customizations-work
    stages:

      # Currently, the only supported value is "router".
      router:

        # Define which properties of the request should be transmitted in the payload.
	# Choosing the least amount of data will reduce the size of the payload.
	# By default, all values are false and, when false, their presence in this map is optional.
        request:
          headers: true
          context: true
          body: true
          sdl: true

	# Similar to "request", but which properties of the response should be sent.
	# Again, all values are false by default and only must be specified if they are enabled.
        response:
          headers: true
          context: true
```

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Protoc now required to build ([Issue #1970](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1970))

Protoc is now required to build Apollo Router. Upgrading to Open Telemetry 0.18 has enabled us to upgrade tonic which in turn no longer bundles protoc.
Users must install it themselves https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/.

By [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1970

### Jaeger scheduled_delay moved to batch_processor->scheduled_delay ([Issue #2232](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2232))

Jager config previously allowed configuration of scheduled_delay for batch span processor. To bring it in line with all other exporters this is now set using a batch_processor section.

Before:
```yaml
telemetry:
  tracing:
    jaeger:
      scheduled_delay: 100ms
```

After:
```yaml
telemetry:
  tracing:
    jaeger:
      batch_processor:
        scheduled_delay: 100ms
```

By [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1970

## üöÄ Features

### Add support for experimental tooling ([Issue #2136](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2136))

Display a message at startup listing used `experimental_` configurations with related GitHub discussions.
It also adds a new cli command `router config experimental` to display all available experimental configurations.

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2242

### Re-deploy router pods if the SuperGraph configmap changes ([PR #2223](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2223))
When setting the supergraph with the `supergraphFile` variable a `sha256` checksum is calculated and set as an annotation for the router pods. This will spin up new pods when the supergraph is mounted via config map and the schema has changed.

Note: It is preferable to not have `--hot-reload` enabled with this feature since re-configuring the router during a pod restart is duplicating the work and may cause confusion in log messaging.

By [@toneill818](https://github.com/toneill818) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2223

### Tracing batch span processor is now configurable ([Issue #2232](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2232))

Exporting traces often requires performance tuning based on the throughput of the router, sampling settings and ingestion capability of tracing ingress.

All exporters now support configuring the batch span processor in the router yaml.
```yaml
telemetry:
  apollo:
    batch_processor:
      scheduled_delay: 100ms
      max_concurrent_exports: 1000
      max_export_batch_size: 10000
      max_export_timeout: 100s
      max_queue_size: 10000
  tracing:
    jaeger|zipkin|otlp|datadog:
      batch_processor:
        scheduled_delay: 100ms
        max_concurrent_exports: 1000
        max_export_batch_size: 10000
        max_export_timeout: 100s
        max_queue_size: 10000
```

See the Open Telemetry docs for more information.

### Add hot-reload support for Rhai scripts ([Issue #1071](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1071))

The router will "watch" your "rhai.scripts" directory for changes and prompt an interpreter re-load if changes are detected. Changes are defined as:

 * creating a new file with a ".rhai" suffix
 * modifying or removing an existing file with a ".rhai" suffix

The watch is recursive, so files in sub-directories of the "rhai.scripts" directory are also watched.

The Router attempts to identify errors in scripts before applying the changes. If errors are detected, these will be logged and the changes will not be applied to the runtime. Not all classes of error can be reliably detected, so check the log output of your router to make sure that changes have been applied.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2198

### Add support for working with multi-value header keys to Rhai ([Issue #2211](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2211), [Issue #2255](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2255))

Adds support for setting a header map key with an array. This causes the HeaderMap key/values to be appended() to the map, rather than inserted().

Adds support for a new `values()` fn which retrieves multiple values for a HeaderMap key as an array.

Example use from Rhai as:

```
  response.headers["set-cookie"] = [
    "foo=bar; Domain=localhost; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 04 Jan 2023 17:25:27 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None",
    "foo2=bar2; Domain=localhost; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 04 Jan 2023 17:25:27 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None",
  ];
  response.headers.values("set-cookie"); // Returns the array of values
```

## üêõ Fixes

### Filter nullified deferred responses ([Issue #2213](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2168))

[`@defer` spec updates](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/compare/01d7b98f04810c9a9db4c0e53d3c4d54dbf10b82...f58632f496577642221c69809c32dd46b5398bd7#diff-0f02d73330245629f776bb875e5ca2b30978a716732abca136afdd028d5cd33cR448-R470) mandates that a deferred response should not be sent if its path points to an element of the response that was nullified in a previous payload.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2184

### Return root `__typename` when parts of a query with deferred fragment ([Issue #1677](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1677))

With this query:

```graphql
{
  __typename
  fast
  ...deferedFragment @defer
}

fragment deferedFragment on Query {
  slow
}
```

You will receive the first response chunk:

```json
{"data":{"__typename": "Query", "fast":0},"hasNext":true}
```

### Wait for opentelemetry tracer provider to shutdown ([PR #2191](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2191))

When we drop Telemetry we spawn a thread to perform the global opentelemetry trace provider shutdown. The documentation of this function indicates that "This will invoke the shutdown method on all span processors. span processors should export remaining spans before return". We should give that process some time to complete (5 seconds currently) before returning from the `drop`. This will provide more opportunity for spans to be exported.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2191
### Dispatch errors from the primary response to deferred responses ([Issue #1818](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1818), [Issue #2185](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2185))

When errors are generated during the primary execution, some may also be assigned to deferred responses.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2192

### Reconstruct deferred queries with knowledge about fragments ([Issue #2105](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2105))

When we are using `@defer`, response formatting must apply on a subset of the query (primary or deferred), that is reconstructed from information provided by the query planner: a path into the response and a subselection. Previously, that path did not include information on fragment application, which resulted in query reconstruction issues if `@defer` was used under a fragment application on an interface.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Improve plugin registration predictability ([PR #2181](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2181))

This replaces [ctor](https://crates.io/crates/ctor) with [linkme](https://crates.io/crates/linkme). `ctor` enables rust code to execute before `main`. This can be a source of undefined behaviour and we don't need our code to execute before `main`. `linkme` provides a registration mechanism that is perfect for this use case, so switching to use it makes the router more predictable, simpler to reason about and with a sound basis for future plugin enhancements.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2181

### it_rate_limit_subgraph_requests fixed ([Issue #2213](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2213))

This test was failing frequently due to it being a timing test being run in a single threaded tokio runtime.

### Remove spaceport ([Issue #2233](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2233))

Removal significantly simplifies telemetry code and likely to increase performance and reliability.

By [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1970

### Update to Rust 1.65 ([Issue #2220](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2220))

Rust MSRV incremented to 1.65.

By [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2221 and https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2240

### Improve automated release ([Pull #2220](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2256))

Improved the automated release to:
* Update the scaffold files
* Improve the names of prepare release steps in circle.

# [1.5.0] - 2022-12-06
## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Router debug Docker images now run under the control of heaptrack ([Issue #2135](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2135))

From 1.5.0, our debug Docker image will invoke the router under the control of heaptrack. We are making this change to make it simple for users to investigate potential memory issues with the Router.

Do not run debug images in performance sensitive contexts. The tracking of memory allocations will significantly impact performance. In general, the debug image should only be used in consultation with Apollo engineering and support.

Look at our documentation for examples of how to use the image in either Docker or Kubernetes.

### Fix naming inconsistency of telemetry.metrics.common.attributes.router ([Issue #2076](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2076))

Mirroring the rest of the config `router` should be `supergraph`

```yaml
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      attributes:
        router: # old
```
becomes
```yaml
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      attributes:
        supergraph: # new
```

By [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2116

### CLI structure changes ([Issue #2123](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2123))

There is now a separate subcommand for config related operations:
* `config`
  * `schema` - Output the configuration schema
  * `upgrade` - Upgrade the configuration with optional diff support.

`router --schema` has been deprecated and users should move to `router config schema`.

By [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2116

## üöÄ Features

### Add configuration for trace ID ([Issue #2080](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2080))

Trace ids can be propagated directly from a request header:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    propagation:
      # If you have your own way to generate a trace id and you want to pass it via a custom request header
      request:
        header_name: my-trace-id
```
In addition, trace id can be exposed via a response header:
```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    experimental_response_trace_id:
      enabled: true # default: false
      header_name: "my-trace-id" # default: "apollo-trace-id"
```

Using this configuration you will have a response header called `my-trace-id` containing the trace ID. It could help you to debug a specific query if you want to grep your log with this trace id to have more context.

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2131

### Add configuration for logging and add more logs ([Issue #1998](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1998))

By default, logs do not contain request body, response body or headers.
It is now possible to conditionally add this information for debugging and audit purposes.
Here is an example how you can configure it:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  experimental_logging:
    format: json # By default it's "pretty" if you are in an interactive shell session
    display_filename: true # Display filename where the log is coming from. Default: true
    display_line_number: false # Display line number in the file where the log is coming from. Default: true
    # If one of these headers matches we will log supergraph and subgraphs requests/responses
    when_header:
      - name: apollo-router-log-request
        value: my_client
        headers: true # default: false
        body: true # default: false
      # log request for all requests/responses headers coming from Iphones
      - name: user-agent
        match: ^Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone*
        headers: true
```

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2040

### Provide multi-arch (amd64/arm64) Docker images for the Router ([Issue #1932](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1932))

From 1.5.0 our Docker images will be multi-arch.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2138

### Add a supergraph configmap option to the helm chart ([PR #2119](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2119))

Adds the capability to create a configmap containing your supergraph schema. Here's an example of how you could make use of this from your values.yaml and with the `helm` install command.

```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: APOLLO_ROUTER_SUPERGRAPH_PATH
    value: /data/supergraph-schema.graphql

extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: supergraph-schema
    mountPath: /data
    readOnly: true

extraVolumes:
  - name: supergraph-schema
    configMap:
      name: "{{ .Release.Name }}-supergraph"
      items:
        - key: supergraph-schema.graphql
          path: supergraph-schema.graphql
```

With that values.yaml content, and with your supergraph schema in a file name supergraph-schema.graphql, you can execute:

```
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --namespace router-test --set-file supergraphFile=supergraph-schema.graphql router-test oci://ghcr.io/apollographql/helm-charts/router --version 1.0.0-rc.9 --values values.yaml
```

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2119

### Configuration upgrades ([Issue #2123](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2123))

Occasionally we will make changes to the Router yaml configuration format.
When starting the Router, if the configuration can be upgraded, it will do so automatically and display a warning:

```
2022-11-22T14:01:46.884897Z  WARN router configuration contains deprecated options:

  1. telemetry.tracing.trace_config.attributes.router has been renamed to 'supergraph' for consistency

These will become errors in the future. Run `router config upgrade <path_to_router.yaml>` to see a suggested upgraded configuration.
```

Note: If a configuration has errors after upgrading then the configuration will not be upgraded automatically.

From the CLI users can run:
* `router config upgrade <path_to_router.yaml>` to output configuration that has been upgraded to match the latest config format.
* `router config upgrade --diff <path_to_router.yaml>` to output a diff e.g.
```
 telemetry:
   apollo:
     client_name_header: apollographql-client-name
   metrics:
     common:
       attributes:
-        router:
+        supergraph:
           request:
             header:
             - named: "1" # foo
```

### *Experimental* ü•º subgraph request retry ([Issue #338](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/338), [Issue #1956](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1956))

Implements subgraph request retries, using Finagle's retry buckets algorithm:
- it defines a minimal number of retries per second (`min_per_sec`, default is 10 retries per second), to
bootstrap the system or for low traffic deployments
- for each successful request, we add a "token" to the bucket, those tokens expire after `ttl` (default: 10 seconds)
- the number of available additional retries is a part of the number of tokens, defined by `retry_percent` (default is 0.2)

Request retries are disabled by default on mutations.

This is activated in the `traffic_shaping` plugin, either globally or per subgraph:

```yaml
traffic_shaping:
  all:
    experimental_retry:
      min_per_sec: 10
      ttl: 10s
      retry_percent: 0.2
      retry_mutations: false
  subgraphs:
    accounts:
      experimental_retry:
        min_per_sec: 20
```

### *Experimental* ü•º Caching configuration ([Issue #2075](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2075))

Split Redis cache configuration for APQ and query planning:

```yaml
supergraph:
  apq:
    experimental_cache:
      in_memory:
        limit: 512
      redis:
        urls: ["redis://..."]
  query_planning:
    experimental_cache:
      in_memory:
        limit: 512
      redis:
        urls: ["redis://..."]
```

# [1.4.0] - 2022-11-15

## üöÄ Features

### Add support for returning different HTTP status codes in Rhai ([Issue #2023](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2023))

It is now possible to return different HTTP status codes when raising an exception in Rhai. You do this by providing an object map with two keys: `status` and `message`, rather than merely a string as was the case previously.

```rust
throw #{
    status: 403,
    message: "I have raised a 403"
};
```

This example will short-circuit request/response processing and return with an HTTP status code of 403 to the client and also set the error message accordingly.

It is still possible to return errors using the current pattern, which will continue to return HTTP status code 500 as previously:

```rust
throw "I have raised an error";
```

> It is not currently possible to return a 200 status code using this pattern. If you try, it will be implicitly converted into a 500 error.

### Add support for `urlencode()` / `decode()` in Rhai ([Issue #2052](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2052))

### **Experimental** ü•º External cache storage in Redis ([PR #2024](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2024))

We are experimenting with introducing external storage for caches in the Router, which will provide a foundation for caching things like automated persisted queries (APQ) amongst other future-looking ideas.  Our initial implementation supports a multi-level cache hierarchy, first attempting an in-memory LRU-cache, proceeded by a Redis Cluster backend.

As this is still experimental, it is only available as an opt-in through a Cargo feature-flag.

## üêõ Fixes

### Move error messages about nullifying into `extensions` ([Issue #2071](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2071))

The Router was previously creating and returning error messages in `errors` when nullability rules had been triggered (e.g., when a _non-nullable_ field was `null`, it nullifies the parent object).  These are now emitted into a `valueCompletion` portion of the `extensions` response.

Adding those messages in the list of `errors` was potentially redundant and resulted in failures by clients (such as the Apollo Client error policy, by default) which would otherwise have expected nullified fields as part of normal operation execution.  Additionally, the subgraph could already add such an error message indicating why a field was null which would cause the error to be doubled.

### Fix `Float` input-type coercion for default values with values larger than 32-bit ([Issue #2087](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2087))

A regression has been fixed which caused the Router to reject integers larger than 32-bits used as the default values on `Float` fields in input types.

    a_float_input: Float = 9876543210

## üõ† Maintenance

### Use `debian:bullseye-slim` as our base Docker image ([PR #2085](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2085))

A while ago, when we added compression support to the router, we discovered that the Distroless base-images we were using didn't ship with a copy of `libz.so.1`. We addressed that problem by copying in a version of the library from the Distroless image (Java) which does ship it. While that worked, we found challenges in adding support for both `aarch64` and `amd64` Docker images that would make it less than ideal to continue using those Distroless images.

Rather than persist with this complexity, we've concluded that it would be better to just use a base image which ships with `libz.so.1`, hence the change to `debian:bullseye-slim`.  Those images are still quite minimal and the resulting images are similar in size.

### Add `trace_id` in logs to correlate entries from the same request ([Issue #1981](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1981))

A `trace_id` is now added to each log line to help correlate log entries to specific requests.  The value for this property will be automatically inherited from any enabled distributed tracing headers, such as those listed in our [Tracing propagation header](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/tracing/#propagation) documentation (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog, etc.).

In the event that a `trace_id` was not inherited from a propagated header, the Router will originate a `trace_id` and propagate that ID to subgraphs if header propagation (see link above) is enabled.

Here is an example of the `trace_id` appearing in plain-text log output:

```
2022-10-21T15:17:45.562553Z ERROR [trace_id=5e6a6bda8d0dca26e5aec14dafa6d96f] apollo_router::services::subgraph_service: fetch_error="hyper::Error(Connect, ConnectError(\"tcp connect error\", Os { code: 111, kind: ConnectionRefused, message: \"Connection refused\" }))"

When operating in a [Managed Federation configuration](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/overview/) and fetching the supergraph from Apollo Uplink, the Router will now react differently depending on the response from Apollo Uplink, rather than retrying incessantly:

- Not attempt to retry when met with unrecoverable conditions (e.g., a Graph that does not exist).

### Address regression when sending gRPC to `localhost` ([Issue #2036](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2036))

We again support sending unencrypted gRPC tracing and metrics data to `localhost`.  This follows-up on a regression which occurred in the previous release which addressed a limitation which prevented sending gRPC to TLS-secured endpoints.

Applying a proper fix was complicated by an upstream issue ([opentelemetry-rust#908](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust/issues/908)) which incorrectly assumes `https` in the absence of a more-specific protocol/schema, contrary to the OpenTelmetry specification which indicates otherwise.

The Router will now detect and work-around this upstream issue by explicitly setting the full, correct endpoint URLs when not specified in config.

In addition:

- Basic TLS-encyrption will be enabled when the endpoint scheme is explicitly `https`.
- A _warning_ will be emitted if the endpoint port is 443 but *no* TLS config is specified since _most_ traffic on port 443 is expected to be encrypted.

This affected two different metrics differently:

- The `apollo_router_http_requests_error_total` metric only incremented for requests that would be an `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` in the Router (the service stack returning a `BoxError`).  This meant that GraphQL validation errors were not increment this counter.

- The `apollo_router_http_requests_total` metric would only increment for _successful_ requests despite the fact that the Prometheus documentation suggests this should be incremented _regardless_ of whether the request succeeded or not.

This PR makes sure we always increment `apollo_router_http_requests_total` and we increment `apollo_router_http_requests_error_total` when the status code is 4xx or 5xx.

If the `Accept` header contained `multipart/mixed`, even with other alternatives like `application/json`,
a query with a single response was still sent as multipart, which made Apollo Studio Explorer fail on the initial introspection query.

This changes the logic so that:

- If the client has indicated an `accept` of `application/json` or `*/*` and there is a single response, it will be delivered as `content-type: application/json`.
- If there are multiple responses or the client only accepts `multipart/mixed`, we will send `content-type: multipart/mixed` response.  This will occur even if there is only one response.
- Otherwise, we will return an HTTP status code of `406 Not Acceptable`.

> Note the breaking change is not for the Router itself, but for the [Router helm chart](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/helm-charts%2Frouter) which is still [1.0.0-rc.5](https://github.com/orgs/apollographql/packages/container/helm-charts%2Frouter/45240873?tag=1.0.0-rc.5)

### Remove support for `rhai.input_file` from the helm chart ([Issue #1826](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1826))

The existing `rhai.input_file` mechanism doesn't really work for most helm use cases. This PR removes this mechanism and and encourages the use of the `extraVolumes/extraVolumeMounts` mechanism with rhai.

Example: Create a configmap which contains your rhai scripts.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: rhai-config
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: rhai-config
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: rhai-config
data:
  main.rhai: |
    // Call map_request with our service and pass in a string with the name
    // of the function to callback
    fn subgraph_service(service, subgraph) {
        print(`registering request callback for ${subgraph}`);
        const request_callback = Fn("process_request");
        service.map_request(request_callback);
    }

    // This will convert all cookie pairs into headers.
    // If you only wish to convert certain cookies, you
    // can add logic to modify the processing.
    fn process_request(request) {

        // Find our cookies
        if "cookie" in request.headers {
            print("adding cookies as headers");
            let cookies = request.headers["cookie"].split(';');
            for cookie in cookies {
                // Split our cookies into name and value
                let k_v = cookie.split('=', 2);
                if k_v.len() == 2 {
                    // trim off any whitespace
                    k_v[0].trim();
                    k_v[1].trim();
                    // update our headers
                    // Note: we must update subgraph.headers, since we are
                    // setting a header in our sub graph request
                    request.subgraph.headers[k_v[0]] = k_v[1];
                }
            }
        } else {
            print("no cookies in request");
        }
    }
  my-module.rhai: |
    fn process_request(request) {
        print("processing a request");
    }
```
Note how the data represents multiple rhai source files. The module code isn't used, it's just there to illustrate multiple files in a single configmap.

With that configmap in place, the helm chart can be used with a values file that contains:

```yaml
router:
  configuration:
    rhai:
      scripts: /dist/rhai
      main: main.rhai
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: rhai-volume
    mountPath: /dist/rhai
    readonly: true
extraVolumes:
  - name: rhai-volume
    configMap:
      name: rhai-config
```
The configuration tells the router to load the rhai script `main.rhai` from the directory `/dist/rhai` (and load any imported modules from /dist/rhai)

This will mount the confimap created above in the `/dist/rhai` directory with two files:
 - `main.rhai`
 - `my-module.rhai`

## üöÄ Features

### Expose the TraceId functionality to rhai ([Issue #1935](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1935))

A new function, traceid(), is exposed to rhai scripts which may be used to retrieve a unique trace id for a request. The trace id is an opentelemetry span id.

```
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    try {
        let id = traceid();
        print(`id: ${id}`);
    }
    catch(err)
    {
        // log any errors
        log_error(`span id error: ${err}`);
    }
}
```

## üêõ Fixes

### Fix studio reporting failures ([Issue #1903](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1903))

The root cause of the issue was letting the server component of spaceport close silently during a re-configuration or schema reload. This fixes the issue by keeping the server component alive as long as the client remains connected.

Additionally, recycled spaceport connections are now re-connected to spaceport to further ensure connection validity.

### Add support for dynamic header injection ([Issue #1755](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1755))

The following are now possible in our YAML configuration for `headers`:

- Insert static header

  ```yaml
  headers:
    all: # Header rules for all subgraphs
      request:
      - insert:
          name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router"
          value: "indeed"
  ```

- Insert header from context

  ```yaml
  headers:
    all: # Header rules for all subgraphs
      request:
      - insert:
          name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router-context"
          from_context: "my_key_in_context"
  ```

- Insert header from request body

  ```yaml
  headers:
    all: # Header rules for all subgraphs
      request:
      - insert:
          name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router-request-body"
          path: ".operationName" # It's a JSON path query to fetch the operation name from request body
          default: "UNKNOWN" # If no operationName has been specified

### Fix external secret support in our Helm chart ([Issue #1750](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1750))

If an external secret is specified, e.g.:

```

### Do not erase errors when missing `_entities` ([Issue #1863](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1863))

In a federated query, if the subgraph returned a response with `errors` and a `null` or absent `data` field, the Router was ignoring the subgraph error and instead returning an error complaining about the missing` _entities` field.

The Router will now aggregate the subgraph error and the missing `_entities` error.

### Fix Prometheus annotation and healthcheck default

The Prometheus annotation is breaking on a `helm upgrade` so this fixes the template and also sets defaults. Additionally, defaults are now set for `health-check`'s `listen` to be `0.0.0.0:8088` within the Helm chart.

### Move response formatting to the execution service ([PR #1771](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1771))

The response formatting process (in which response data is filtered according to deferred responses subselections and the API schema) was being executed in the `supergraph` service. This was a bit late since it resulted in the `execution` service returning a stream of invalid responses leading to the execution plugins operating on invalid data.

Prior to this change, span details were written to log files. This was unwieldy and contributed to log bloat. Spans and logs are still linked in trace aggregators, such as jaeger, and this change simply affects the content of the written to the console output.

### Set MSRV to 1.63.0 ([PR #1886](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1886))

We compile and test with 1.63.0 on CI at the moment, so it is our de-facto Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV).

Setting [`rust-version`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-rust-version-field) in `Cargo.toml` provides a more helpful error message when using an older version rather than unexpected compilation errors.

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Removed `Request::from_bytes()` from public API ([Issue #1855](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1855))

We've removed `Request::from_bytes()` from the public API.  We were no longer using it internally and we hardly expect anyone external to have been relying on it so it was worth the remaining breaking change prior to v1.0.0.

We discovered this function during an exercise of documenting our entire public API.  While we considered keeping it, it didn't necessarily meet our requirements for shipping it in the public API.  It's internal usage was removed in [`d147f97d`](https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/d147f97d as part of [PR #429](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/429).

We're happy to consider re-introducing this in the future (it even has a matching `Response::from_bytes()` which it composes against nicely!), but we thought it was best to remove it for the time-being.

## üöÄ Features

### Reintroduce health check ([Issue #1861](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1861))

We have re-introduced a health check at the `/health` endpoint on a dedicated port that is not exposed on the default GraphQL execution port (`4000`) but instead on port `8088`.  **We recommend updating from the previous health-point suggestion by consulting our [health check configuration](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/health-checks/) documentation.**  This health check endpoint will act as an "overall" health check for the Router and we intend to add separate "liveliness" and "readiness" checks on their own dedicated endpoints (e.g., `/health/live` and `/health/ready`) in the future.  At that time, this root `/health` check will aggregate all other health checks to provide an overall health status however, today, it is simply a "liveliness" check and we have not defined "readiness".  We also intend to use port `8088` for other ("internal") functionality in the future, keeping the GraphQL execution endpoint dedicated to serving external client requests.

As for some additional context as to why we've brought it back so quickly: We had previously removed the health check we had been offering in [PR #1766](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1766) because we wanted to do some additional configurationd design and lean into a new "admin port" (`8088`).  As a temporary solution, we offered the instruction to send a `GET` query to the Router with a GraphQL query.  After some new learnings and feedback, we've had to re-visit that conversation earlier than we expected!

Due to [default CSRF protections](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/csrf/) enabled in the Router, `GET` requests need to be accompanied by certain HTTP headers in order to disqualify them as being [CORS-preflightable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request) requests.  While sending the additional header was reasonable straightforward in Kubernetes, other environments (including Google Kubernetes Engine's managed load balancers) didn't offer the ability to send those necessary HTTP headers along with their `GET` queries.  So, the `/health` endpoint is back.

The health check endpoint is now exposed on `127.0.0.1:8088/health` by default, and its `listen` socket address can be changed in the YAML configuration:

```yaml
health-check:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:8088 # default
  enabled: true # default
```

The previous health-check suggestion (i.e., `GET /?query={__typename}`) will still work, so long as your infrastructure supports sending custom HTTP headers with HTTP requests.  Again though, we recommend updating to the new health check.

### Do not fill in a skeleton object when canceling a subgraph request ([Discussion #1377](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/1377#discussioncomment-3655967))

Given a supergraph with multiple subgraphs `USER` and `ORGA`, like [this example supergraph](https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/d0a02525c670e4317586100a31fdbdcd95c6ef07/apollo-router/src/services/supergraph_service.rs#L586-L623), if a query spans multiple subgraphs, like this:

```graphql
query {
  currentUser { # USER subgraph
    activeOrganization { # ORGA subgraph
      id
      creatorUser {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

...when the `USER` subgraph returns `{"currentUser": { "activeOrganization": null }}`, then the request to the `ORGA` subgraph
should be _cancelled_ and no data should be generated.   This was not occurring since the query planner was incorrectly creating an object at the target path.  This is now corrected.

This fix also improves the internal usage of mocked subgraphs with `TestHarness`.

### Deny `panic`, `unwrap` and `expect` in the spec module ([PR #1844](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1844))

We are generally working to eliminate `unwrap()` and `expect()` statements from critical paths in the codebase and have done so on the `spec` module.  The `spec` module, in particular, is reached after parsing has occurred so any invariants expressed by these `expect`s would have already been enforced or validated.  Still, we've decided to tighten things even further, by raising errors instead to provide end-users with even more stability.

To further defend against re-introduction, the `spec` module now has linting annotations that prevent its content from using any code that explicitly panics.

#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used)]
#![deny(clippy::expect_used)]
#![deny(clippy::panic)]

### Remove potential panics from query plan execution ([PR #1842](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1842))

Some remaining parts of the query plan execution code were using `expect()`, `unwrap()` and `panic()` to guard against assumptions
about data.  These conditions have been replaced with errors which will returned in the response preventing the possibility of panics in these code paths.

# [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2022-09-16

> **Note**
> We're almost to 1.0! We've got a couple relatively small breaking changes to the configuration for this release (none to the API) that should be relatively easy to adapt to and a number of bug fixes and usability improvements.

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Change `headers` propagation configuration ([PR #1795](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1795))

While it wasn't necessary today, we want to avoid a necessary breaking change in the future by proactively making room for up-and-coming work.  We've therefore introduced another level into the `headers` configuration with a `request` object, to allow for a `response` (see [Issue #1284](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1284)) to be an _additive_ feature after 1.0.

A rough look at this should just be a matter of adding in `request` and indenting everything that was inside it:

```patch
headers:
    all:
+     request:
          - remove:
              named: "test"
```

The good news is that we'll have `response` in the future!  For a full set of examples, please see the [header propagation documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/header-propagation/).

### Bind the Sandbox on the same endpoint as the Supergraph, again ([Issue #1785](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1785))

We have rolled back an addition that we released in this week's `v1.0.0-rc.0` which allowed Sandbox (an HTML page that makes requests to the `supergraph` endpoint) to be on a custom socket.  In retrospect, we believe it was premature to make this change without considering the broader impact of this change which ultimately touches on CORS and some developer experiences bits.  Practically speaking, we may not want to introduce this because it complicates the model in a number of ways.

For the foreseeable future, Sandbox will continue to be on the same listener address as the `supergraph` listener.

It's unlikely anyone has really leaned into this much already, but if you've already re-configured `sandbox` or `homepage` to be on a custom `listen`-er and/or `path` in `1.0.0-rc.0`, here is a diff of what you should remove:

```diff
sandbox:
-  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
-  path: /
  enabled: false
homepage:
-  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
-  path: /
  enabled: true
```

Note this means you can either enable the `homepage`, or the `sandbox`, but not both.

## üöÄ Features

### Automatically check "Return Query Plans from Router" checkbox in Sandbox ([Issue #1803](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1803))

When loading Sandbox, we now automatically configure it to toggle the "Request query plans from Router" checkbox to the enabled position which requests query plans from the Apollo Router when executing operations.  These query plans are displayed in the Sandbox interface and can be seen by selecting "Query Plan Preview" from the drop-down above the panel on the right side of the interface.

By [@abernix](https://github.com/abernix) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1804

## üêõ Fixes

### Fix `--dev` mode when no configuration file is specified ([Issue #1801](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1801)) ([Issue #1802](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1802))

We've reconciled an issue where the `--dev` mode flag was being ignored when running the router without a configuration file.  (While many use cases do require a configuration file, the Router actually doesn't _need_ a confguration in many cases!)

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1808

### Respect `supergraph`'s `path` for Kubernetes deployment probes ([Issue #1787](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1787))

If you've configured the `supergraph`'s `path` property using the Helm chart, the liveness
and readiness probes now utilize these correctly.  This fixes a bug where they continued to use the _default_ path of `/` and resulted in a startup failure.

By [@damienpontifex](https://github.com/damienpontifex) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1788

### Get variable default values from the query for query plan condition nodes ([PR #1640](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1640))

The query plan condition nodes, generated by the `if` argument of the  `@defer` directive, were
not using the default value of the variable passed in as an argument.

This _also_ fixes _default value_ validations for non-`@defer`'d queries.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1640

### Correctly hot-reload when changing the `supergraph`'s `listen` socket ([Issue #1814](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1814))

If you change the `supergraph`'s `listen` socket while in `--hot-reload` mode, the Router will now correctly pickup the change and bind to the new socket.

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1815

## üõ† Maintenance

### Improve error message when querying non existent field ([Issue #1816](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1816))

When querying a non-existent field you will get a better error message:

```patch
{
  "errors": [
    {
-       "message": "invalid type error, expected another type than 'Named type Computer'"
+       "message": "Cannot query field \"xxx\" on type \"Computer\""
    }
  ]
}
```

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1817

### Update `apollo-router-scaffold` to use the published `apollo-router` crate [PR #1782](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1782)

Now that `apollo-router` is released on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/apollo-router), we have updated the project scaffold to rely on the published crate instead of Git tags.

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1782

### Refactor `Configuration` validation ([Issue #1791](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1791))

Instantiating `Configuration`s is now fallible, because it will run consistency checks on top of the already run structure checks.

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1794

### Refactor response-formatting tests ([Issue #1798](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1798))

Rewrite the response-formatting tests to use a builder pattern instead of macros and move the tests to a separate file.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1798

## üìö Documentation

### Add `rustdoc` documentation to various modules ([Issue #799](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/799))

Adds documentation for:

- `apollo-router/src/layers/instrument.rs`
- `apollo-router/src/layers/map_first_graphql_response.rs`
- `apollo-router/src/layers/map_future_with_request_data.rs`
- `apollo-router/src/layers/sync_checkpoint.rs`
- `apollo-router/src/plugin/serde.rs`
- `apollo-router/src/tracer.rs`

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1792

### Fixed `docs.rs` publishing error from our last release

During our last release we discovered for the first time that our documentation wasn't able to compile on the [docs.rs](https://docs.rs) website, leaving our documentation in a [failed state](https://docs.rs/crate/apollo-router/1.0.0-rc.0/builds/629200).

While we've reconciled _that particular problem_, we're now being affected by [this](https://docs.rs/crate/router-bridge/0.1.7/builds/629895) internal compiler errors (ICE) that [is affecting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/101844) anyone using `1.65.0-nightly` builds circa today.  Since docs.rs uses `nightly` for all builds, this means it'll be a few more days before we're published there.

# [1.0.0-rc.0] - 2022-09-14

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

> **Note**
> We are entering our release candidate ("RC") stage and expect this to be the last of our breaking changes.  Overall, most of the breaking changes in this release revolve around three key factors which were motivators for most of the changes:
>
> 1. Having **safe and security defaults** which are suitable for production
> 2. Polishing our YAML configuration ergonomics and patterns
> 3. The introduction of a development mode activated with the `--dev` flag
>
> See the full changelog below for details on these (including the "Features" section for the `--dev` changes!)

### Adjusted socket ("listener") addresses for more secure default behaviors

- The Router will not listen on "all interfaces" in its default configuration (i.e., by binding to `0.0.0.0`).  You may specify a specific socket by specifying the `interface:port` combination.  If you desire behavior which binds to all interfaces, your configuration can specify a socket of `0.0.0.0:4000` (for port `4000` on all interfaces).
- By default, Prometheus (if enabled) no longer listens on the same socket as the GraphQL socket.  You can change this behavior by binding it to the same socket as your GraphQL socket in your configuration.
- The health check endpoint is no longer available on the same socket as the GraphQL endpoint (In fact, the health check suggestion has changed in ways that are described elsewhere in this release's notes.  Please review them separately!)

### Safer out-of-the box defaults with `sandbox` and `introspection` disabled ([PR #1748](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1748))

To reflect the fact that it is not recomended to have introspection on in production (and since Sandbox uses introspection to power its development features) the `sandbox` and `introspection` configuration are now **disabled unless you are running the Router with `--dev`**.

If you would like to force them on even when outside of `--dev` mode, you can set them to `true` explicitly in your YAML configuration:

```yaml
sandbox:
  enabled: true
supergraph:
  introspection: true
```

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1748

### Landing page ("home page") replaces Sandbox in default "production" mode ([PR #1768](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1768))

As an extension of Sandbox and Introspection being disabled by default (see above), the Router now displays a simple landing page when running in its default mode.  When you run the Apollo Router with the new `--dev` flag (see "Features" section below) you will still see the existing "Apollo Studio Sandbox" experience.

We will offer additional options to customize the landing page in the future but for now you can disable the homepage entirely (leaving a _very_ generic page with a GraphQL message) by disabling the homepage entirely in your configuration:

```yaml
homepage:
  enabled: false
```

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1768

### Listeners, paths and paths can be configured individually  ([Issue #1500](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1500))

It is now possible to individually configure the following features' socket/listener addresses (i.e., the IP address and port) in addition to the URL path:

- GraphQL execution (default: `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`)
- Sandbox (default when using `--dev`: `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`)
- Prometheus (default when enabled: `http://127.0.0.1:9090/metrics`)

Examples of how to configure these can be seen in the YAML configuration overhaul section of this changelog (just below) as well as in our documentation.

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1718

### Overhaul/reorganization of YAML configuration ([#1500](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1500))

To facilitate the changes in the previous bullet-points, we have moved configuration parameters which previously lived in the `server` section to new homes in the configuration, including `listen`, `graphql_path`, `landing_page`, and `introspection`.  Additionally, `preview_defer_support` has moved, but is on by default and no longer necessary to be set explicitly unless you wish to disable it.

As another section (below) notes, we have *removed* the health check and instead recommend users to configure their health checks (in, e.g, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.) to use a simple GraphQL query: `/?query={__typename}`.  Read more about that in the other section, however this is reflected by its removal in the configuration.

To exemplify the changes, this previous configuration will turn into the configuration that follows it:

#### Before

```yaml
server:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
  graphql_path: /graphql
  health_check_path: /health # Health check has been deprecated.  See below.
  introspection: false
  preview_defer_support: true
  landing_page: true
telemetry:
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
```

#### After

```yaml
# This section is just for Sandbox configuration
sandbox:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
  path: /
  enabled: false # Disabled by default, but on with `--dev`.

# This section represents general supergraph GraphQL execution
supergraph:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
  path: /
  introspection: false
  # Can be removed unless it needs to be set to `false`.
  preview_defer_support: true

# The health check has been removed.  See the section below in the CHANGELOG
# for more information on how to configure health checks going forward.

# Prometheus scraper endpoint configuration
# The `listen` and `path` are not necessary if `127.0.0.1:9090/metrics` is okay
telemetry:
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      listen: 127.0.0.1:9090
      path: /metrics
      enabled: true
```

### Environment variable expansion adjustments ([#1759](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1759))

- Environment expansions **must** be prefixed with `env.`.
- File expansions **must** be prefixed with `file.`.
- The "default" designator token changes from `:` to `:-`. For example:

  `${env.USER_NAME:Nandor}` => `${env.USER_NAME:-Nandor}`

- Failed expansions now result in an error

  Previously expansions that failed due to missing environment variables were silently skipped. Now they result in a configuration error. Add a default value using the above syntax if optional expansion is needed.

By [@BrynCooke](https://github.com/BrynCooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1763

### Dedicated health check endpoint removed with new recommendation to use `/query={__typename}` query ([Issue #1765](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1765))

We have *removed* the dedicated health check endpoint and now recommend users to configure their health checks (in, e.g, Kubernetes, Docker) to use a simple GraphQL query instead.

Use the following query with a `content-type: application/json` header as a health check instead of `/.well-known/apollo/server-health`:

```
/?query={__typename}
```

The [Kubernetes documentation and related Helm charts](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/containerization/kubernetes) have been updated to reflect this change.

Using this query has the added benefit of *actually testing GraphQL*.  If this query returns with an HTTP 200 OK, it is just as reliable (and even more meaningful) than the previous `/.well-known/apollo/server-health` endpoint.  It's important to include the `content-type: application/json` header to satisfy the Router's secure requirements that offer CSRF protections.

In the future, we will likely reintroduce a dedicated health check "liveliness" endpoint along with a meaningful "readiness" health check at the same time.  In the meantime, the query above is technically more durable than the health check we offered previously.

### Promote `include_subgraph_errors` out of "experimental" status ([Issue #1773](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1773))

The `include_subraph_errors` plugin has been promoted out of "experimental" and will require a small configuration changes.  For example:

```diff
-plugins:
-  experimental.include_subgraph_errors:
-    all: true # Propagate errors from all subraphs
-    subgraphs:
-      products: false # Do not propagate errors from the products subgraph
+include_subgraph_errors:
+  all: true # Propagate errors from all subraphs
+  subgraphs:
+    products: false # Do not propagate errors from the products subgraph
 ```

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1776

### `apollo-spaceport` and `uplink` are now part of `apollo-router` ([Issue #491](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/491))

Instead of being dependencies, they are now part of the `apollo-router` crate.  They were not meant to be used independently.

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1751

### Remove over-exposed functions from the public API ([PR #1746](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1746))

The following functions are only required for router implementation, so removing from external API:

```
subgraph::new_from_response
supergraph::new_from_response
supergraph::new_from_graphql_response
```

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1746

### Span `client_name` and `client_version` attributes renamed ([#1514](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1514))

OpenTelemetry attributes should be grouped by `.` rather than `_`, therefore the following attributes have changed:

* `client_name` => `client.name`
* `client_version` => `client.version`

By [@BrynCooke](https://github.com/BrynCooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1514

### Otel configuration updated to use expansion ([#1772](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1772))

File and env access in configuration now use the generic expansion mechanism introduced in [#1759](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1759).

```yaml
      grpc:
        key:
          file: "foo.txt"
        ca:
          file: "bar.txt"
        cert:
          file: "baz.txt"
```

Becomes:
```yaml
      grpc:
        key: "${file.foo.txt}"
        ca: "${file.bar.txt}"
        cert: "${file.baz.txt}"
```
or
```yaml
      grpc:
        key: "${env.FOO}"
        ca: "${env.BAR}"
        cert: "${env.BAZ}"
```

## üöÄ Features

### Adds a development mode that can be enabled with the `--dev` flag ([#1474](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1474))

By default, the Apollo Router is configured with production best-practices.  When developing, it is often desired to have some of those features relaxed to make it easier to iterate.  A `--dev` flag has been introduced to make the user experience easier while maintaining a default configuration which targets a productionized environment.

The `--dev` mode will enable a few options _for development_ which are not normally on by default:

- The Apollo Sandbox Explorer will be served instead of the Apollo Router landing page, allowing you to run queries against your development Router.
- Introspection will be enabled, allowing client tooling (and Sandbox!) to obtain the latest version of the schema.
- Hot-reloading of configuration will be enabled. (Also available with `--hot-reload` when running without `--dev`)
- It will be possible for Apollo Sandbox Explorer to request a query plan to be returned with any operations it executes. These query plans will allow you to observe how the operation will be executed against the underlying subgraphs.
- Errors received from subgraphs will not have their contents redacted to facilitate debugging.

Additional considerations will be made in the future as we introduce new features that might necessitate a "development" workflow which is different than the default mode of operation.  We will try to minimize these differences to avoid surprises in a production deployment while providing an execellent development experience.  In the future, the (upcoming) `rover dev` experience will become our suggested pattern, but this should serve the purpose in the near term.

### Apollo Studio Federated Tracing ([#1514](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1514))

Add support of [federated tracing](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/metrics/) in Apollo Studio:

```yaml
telemetry:
    apollo:
        # The percentage of requests will include HTTP request and response headers in traces sent to Apollo Studio.
        # This is expensive and should be left at a low value.
        # This cannot be higher than tracing->trace_config->sampler
        field_level_instrumentation_sampler: 0.01 # (default)

        # Include HTTP request and response headers in traces sent to Apollo Studio
        send_headers: # other possible values are all, only (with an array), except (with an array), none (by default)
            except: # Send all headers except referer
            - referer

        # Send variable values in Apollo in traces sent to Apollo Studio
        send_variable_values: # other possible values are all, only (with an array), except (with an array), none (by default)
            except: # Send all variable values except for variable named first
            - first
    tracing:
        trace_config:
            sampler: 0.5 # The percentage of requests that will generate traces (a rate or `always_on` or `always_off`)
```

### Provide access to the supergraph SDL from rhai scripts ([Issue #1735](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1735))

There is a new global constant `apollo_sdl` which can be use to read the
supergraph SDL as a string.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1737

### Add support for `tokio-console` ([PR #1632](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1632))

To aid in debugging the router, this adds support for [tokio-console](https://github.com/tokio-rs/console), enabled by a Cargo feature.

To run the router with tokio-console, build it with `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg tokio_unstable" cargo run --features console`.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1632

### Restore the ability to specify custom schema and configuration sources ([#1733](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1733))

You may now, once again, specify custom schema and config sources when constructing an executable.  We had previously omitted this behavior in our API pruning with the expectation that it was still possible to specify via command line arguments and we almost immediately regretted it.  We're happy to have it back!

```rust
Executable::builder()
  .shutdown(ShutdownSource::None)
  .schema(SchemaSource::Stream(schemas))
  .config(ConfigurationSource::Stream(configs))
  .start()
  .await
```
By [@BrynCooke](https://github.com/BrynCooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1734

### Environment variable expansion prefixing ([#1759](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1759))

The environment variable `APOLLO_ROUTER_CONFIG_ENV_PREFIX` can be used to prefix environment variable lookups during configuration expansion. This feature is undocumented and unsupported and may change at any time.  **We do not recommend using this.**

For example:

`APOLLO_ROUTER_CONFIG_ENV_PREFIX=MY_PREFIX`

Would cause:
`${env.FOO}` to be mapped to `${env.MY_PREFIX_FOO}` when expansion is performed.

By [@BrynCooke](https://github.com/BrynCooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1763

### Environment variable expansion mode configuration ([#1772](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1772))

The environment variable `APOLLO_ROUTER_CONFIG_SUPPORTED_MODES` can be used to restrict which modes can be used for environment expansion. This feature is undocumented and unsupported and may change at any time.  **We do not recommend using this.**

For example:

`APOLLO_ROUTER_CONFIG_SUPPORTED_MODES=env,file` env and file expansion
`APOLLO_ROUTER_CONFIG_SUPPORTED_MODES=env` - only env variable expansion allowed

By [@BrynCooke](https://github.com/BrynCooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1774


## üêõ Fixes

### Support execution of the bare `__typename` field ([Issue #1761](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1761))

For queries like `query { __typename }`, we now perform the expected behavior and return a GraphQL response even if the introspection has been disabled.  (`introspection: false` should only apply to _schema introspeciton_ **not** _type-name introspection_.)

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1762

### Set `hasNext` for the last chunk of a deferred response ([#1687](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1687) [#1745](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1745))

There will no longer be an empty last response `{"hasNext": false}` and the `hasNext` field will be set on the last deferred response. There can still be one edge case where that empty message can occur, if some deferred queries were cancelled too quickly.  Generally speaking, clients should expect this to happen to allow future behaviors and this is specified in the `@defer` draft specification.

### Add errors vec in `QueryPlannerResponse` to handle errors in `query_planning_service` ([PR #1504](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1504))

We changed `QueryPlannerResponse` to:

- Add a `Vec<apollo_router::graphql::Error>`
- Make the query plan optional, so that it is not present when the query planner encountered a fatal error. Such an error would be in the `Vec`

This should improve the messages returned during query planning.

### Store the Apollo usage reporting Protobuf interface file in the repository

Previously this file was downloaded when compiling the Router, but we had no good way to automatically check when to re-download it without causing the Router to be compiled all the time.

Instead a copy now resides in the repository, with a test checking that it is up to date.  This file can be updated by running this command then sending a PR:

```
curl -f https://usage-reporting.api.apollographql.com/proto/reports.proto \
    > apollo-router/src/spaceport/proto/reports.proto
```

### Disable compression on `multipart/mixed` HTTP responses ([Issue #1572](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1572))

The Router now reverts to using unpatched `async-compression`, and instead disables compression of multipart responses.  We aim to re-enable compression soon, with a proper solution that is being designed in <https://github.com/Nemo157/async-compression/issues/154>.

As context to why we've made this change: features such as `@defer` require the Apollo Router to send a stream of multiple GraphQL responses in a single HTTP response with the body being a single byte stream.  Due to current limitations with our upstream compression library, that entire byte stream is compressed as a whole, which causes the entire deferred response to be held back before being returned.  This obviously isn't ideal for the `@defer` feature which tries to get reponses to client soon possible.

This change replaces our previous work-around which involved a patched `async-compression`, which was not trivial to apply when using the Router as a dependency since [Cargo patching](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html) is done in a project‚Äôs root `Cargo.toml`.

Again, we aim to re-visit this as soon as possible but found this to be the more approachable work-around.

# [1.0.0-alpha.3] - 2022-09-07

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Unified supergraph and execution response types ([PR #1708](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1708))

`apollo_router::services::supergraph::Response` and `apollo_router::services::execution::Response` were two structs with identical fields and almost-identical methods.  The main difference was that builders were fallible for the former but not the latter.

They are now the same type (with one location a `type` alias of the other), with fallible builders.  Callers may need to add either a operator `?` (in plugins) or an `.unwrap()` call (in tests).

```diff
 let response = execution::Response::builder()
     .error(error)
     .status_code(StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST)
     .context(req.context)

### Prometheus is no longer defaulting to the GraphQL endpoint and listener address ([Issue #1645](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1645))

The Router's Prometheus interface is now exposed at `127.0.0.1:9090/metrics`, rather than `http://0.0.0.0:4000/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus`.  This should be both more secure and also more generally compatible with the default settings that Prometheus expects (which also uses port `9090` and just `/metrics` as its defaults).

To expose to a non-localhost interface, it is necessary to explicitly opt-into binding to a socket address of `0.0.0.0:9090` (i.e., all interfaces on port 9090) or a specific available interface (e.g., `192.168.4.1`) on the host.

Have a look at the _Features_ section (below) to learn how to customize the listen address and the path.

## üöÄ Features

### New plugin helper: `map_first_graphql_response` ([Issue #1564](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1564))

In supergraph and execution services, the service response contains not just one GraphQL response but a stream of them, in order to support features such as `@defer`.

This new method of `ServiceExt` and `ServiceBuilderExt` in `apollo_router::layers` wraps a service and calls a `callback` when the first GraphQL response in the stream returned by the inner service becomes available.  The callback can then access the HTTP parts (headers, status code, etc) or the first GraphQL response before returning them.

See the doc-comments in `apollo-router/src/layers/mod.rs` for more.

### Replace `startup` crate with `ctor` crate ([#1704](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1703))

At startup, the router registers plugins. The crate we used to use ([`startup`](https://crates.io/crates/startup/versions)) has been yanked from crates.io and archived on GitHub.  We're unsure why the package was yanked, but we've decided to move to the [`ctor`](https://crates.io/crates/ctor) crate, which is more widely adopted and maintained.

This should fix the sudden errors for those who were using the router as a library or attempting to scaffold a new plugin using `cargo scaffold`.

We now build our macOS binaries with Xcode 13.4 rather than 11.7.  This may result in the Router not working on very old versions of macOS but we'd rather get this out of the way before CircleCI potentially deprecates 11.x images themselves and we're unable to test on them anymore.

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Preserve plugin response `Vary` headers ([PR #1660](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1297))

It is now possible to set a `Vary` header in a client response from a plugin.

> Note: This is a breaking change because the prior behaviour provided three default `Vary` headers and we've had to drop those to enable this change. If, after all plugin processing, there is no `Vary` header, the router will add one with a value of "`origin`", as is best-practice for cache control headers with CORS.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1660

### Fix the supported defer specification version to `20220824` ([PR #1652](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1652))

Since the router will ship before the `@defer` specification is done, we add a parameter to the `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers to indicate which specification version is accepted.

The specification is fixed to [graphql/graphql-spec@01d7b98](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/commit/01d7b98f04810c9a9db4c0e53d3c4d54dbf10b82)

The router will now return a response with the status code `406 Not Acceptable` if the `Accept` header does not match.

### Change default enablement and promote `experimental_defer_support` to `preview_defer_support` ([PR #1673](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1673))

Following up on a tremendous amount of work tracked in https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/80 - which brought various stages of `@defer` support to the Router - this changes our designation of its status from "Experimental" to "Preview".  It's worth noting that the `@defer` specification has *just* graduated to "Stage 2 (Draft)" mode in the GraphQL Working Group, so changes may still be expected and there are two stages ahead.  To help things progress:

- We've lifted the previous requirement that users opt into defer support by setting `experimental_defer_support: true` in the `server` section of their configuration.  It is now on by default.
- The option is now called `preview_defer_support` and it can be set to `false` to _specifically_ opt out of it existing at all.  This might be desired if you would prefer that it not even show up in introspection or be possible to use even if a client requests it.
- Using `@defer` support _requires_ clients set the appropriate HTTP `accept` header to use it.  This puts the burden of understanding the risks of an early-preview on the clients who will need to consume the Router's responses. This is particularly important for clients who have long-lived support requirements (like native mobile apps).

  To see which headers are required, see https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1648.

### Many structs and enums are now `#[non_exhaustive]` ([Issue #1550](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1550))

This means we may adjust `struct` fields or `enum` variants in additive ways in the future without breaking changes.  To prepare for that eventuality:

1. When using a struct pattern (such as for deconstructing a value into its fields),
use `..` to allow further fields:

  ```diff
  -let PluginInit { config, supergraph_sdl } = init;
  +let PluginInit { config, supergraph_sdl, .. } = init;
  ```

2. Use field access instead:

  ```diff
  -let PluginInit { config, supergraph_sdl } = init;
  +let config = init.config;
  +let supergraph_sdl = init.supergraph_sdl;
  ```

3. When constructing a struct, use a builder or constructor method instead of struct literal syntax:

  ```diff
  -let error = graphql::Error {
  -    message: "something went wrong".to_string(),
  -    ..Default::default()
  -};
  +let error = graphql::Error::builder()
  +    .message("something went wrong")
  +    .build();
  ```

4. When matching on an enum, add a wildcard match arm:

  ```diff
  match error {
      ApolloRouterError::StartupError => "StartupError",
      ApolloRouterError::HttpServerLifecycleError => "HttpServerLifecycleError",
      ApolloRouterError::NoConfiguration => "NoConfiguration",
      ApolloRouterError::NoSchema => "NoSchema",
      ApolloRouterError::ServiceCreationError(_) => "ServiceCreationError",
      ApolloRouterError::ServerCreationError(_) => "ServerCreationError",

Deferred responses come as `multipart/mixed` elements and are sent as individual HTTP response chunks. When a client receives one chunk,
that chunk should contain the next delimiter.  This gives the client the ability to start processing the response instead of waiting for the
next chunk just for the delimiter.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1596

### Patch `async-compression` to compress responses in streaming ([PR #1604](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1604))

The `async-compression` crate is a dependency used for HTTP response compression. Its implementation accumulates the entire compressed response in memory before sending it.  However, this created problems for `@defer` responses since we want those responses to come as soon as
possible, rather than waiting until the _entire_ total response has been received and compressed.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1604

### Queries with `@defer` must have the `accept: multipart/mixed` header ([PR #1610](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1610))

Since deferred responses can come back as multipart responses, we must check that the client supports that `content-type`.
This will allow older clients to show a meaningful error message instead of a parsing error if the `@defer` directive is
used but they don't support it.

### Re-organize our release steps checklist ([PR #1605](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1605))

We've got a lot of manual steps we need to do in order to release the Router binarys, but we can at least organize them meaningfuly for ourselves to follow!  This is only a Router-team concern today!

By [@abernix](https://github.com/abernix) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1605)

# [0.16.0] - 2022-08-22

We're getting closer and closer to our 1.0 release and with that we have a lot of polish that we're applying to our API to get it ready for it to be a durable surface area for our consumers to depend on.  Due to various learnings we've had during the pre-1.0 phases of the Router, we are evolving our API to match what we now know.

We do not intend on doing this much moving around of things again soon, but anyone who has been following the repository the last couple weeks knows there has been a lot of activity and discussion about where things should live.  This means that this release has an _abnormally high number of breaking changes_, though we believe you'll find **_most_ of them to be relatively straightforward** to pivot away from.

Please review the full change log to get all the details, but for the most part the changes in this release consist of:

 - a lot of renames of existing symbols
 - the re-location of exported symbols to more appropriate modules
 - the privatization of functions which we don't believe users needed directly (see below if any of these turn out to be a problem).

 During each step of the migration, we recommend **searching this changelog** for a symbol to find advice on how to migrate it.  We've tried to make the instructions and path forward as clear as possible.

- If you find yourself **needing help migrating** to the new patterns, please first take a close look at the examples provided in this change log and if you still need help, please [**open a discussion**](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/).
- If you find yourself **unable to do something** you had previously been able to do, please [**open an issue**](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues).  Please make sure you include your use-case so we can understand better and document it for posterity!

We appreciate your patience working through these and we're excited for the steps ahead!
## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Remove `QueryPlannerService` ([PR #1552](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1552))

This service was redundant, since anything done as part of the `QueryPlannerService` could be done either at the `SupergraphService` or at the `ExecutionService` level.

### Rename `map_future_with_context` to `map_future_with_request_data` ([PR #1547](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1547))

The function is not very well named since it's in fact used to extract any data from a request for use in a future. This rename makes it clear.

### Rename traffic shaping deduplication options ([PR #1540](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1540))

In the traffic shaping module:
 - `variables_deduplication` configuration option is renamed to `deduplicate_variables`.
 - `query_deduplication` configuration option is renamed to `deduplicate_query`.

```diff

### Remove telemetry configuration hot reloading ([PR #1463](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1463))

Configuration hot reloading is not very useful for telemetry, and is the
source of regular bugs that are hard to fix.

This removes the support for configuration reloading entirely. Now, the
router will reject a configuration reload with an error log if the
telemetry configuration changed.

It is now possible to create a subscriber and pass it explicitely to the telemetry plugin
when creating it. It will then be modified to integrate the telemetry plugin's layer.

### Reorder query planner execution ([PR #1484](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1484))

Query planning is deterministic and only depends on the query, operation name and query planning
options. As such, we can cache the result of the entire process.

This changes the pipeline to apply query planner plugins between the cache and the bridge planner,
so those plugins will only be called once on the same query. If changes must be done per query,
they should happen in a supergraph service.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1464

### Remove `Buffer` from `Mock*Service` ([PR #1440](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1440)

This removes the usage of `tower_test::mock::Mock` in mocked services because it isolated the service in a task
so panics triggered by mockall were not transmitted up to the unit test that should catch it.
This rewrites the mocked services API to remove the `build()` method, and make them clonable if needed,
using an `expect_clone` call with mockall.

### Router startup API changes ([PR #1487](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1487))

The `RouterHttpServer::serve` method and its return type `RouterHandle` were removed,
their functionality merged into `RouterHttpServer` (formerly `ApolloRouter`).
The builder for `RouterHttpServer` now ends with a `start` method instead of `build`.
This method immediatly starts the server in a new Tokio task.

```diff
 RouterHttpServer::builder()
     .configuration(configuration)
     .schema(schema)
-    .build()
-    .serve()
+    .start()
     .await
```

### `router_builder_fn` replaced by `shutdown` in the `Executable` builder ([PR #1487](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1487))

The builder for `apollo_router::Executable` had a `router_builder_fn` method
allowing the specification of how a `RouterHttpServer` (previously `ApolloRouter`) was to be created
with a provided configuration and schema.
Since the only possible variation was specifying _when_ the server should shut down
(with a `ShutdownSource` parameter) the `router_builder_fn` was replaced with a new `shutdown` method.

```diff
 use apollo_router::Executable;
-use apollo_router::RouterHttpServer;
 use apollo_router::ShutdownSource;

 Executable::builder()
-    .router_builder_fn(|configuration, schema| RouterHttpServer::builder()
-        .configuration(configuration)
-        .schema(schema)
-        .shutdown(ShutdownSource::None)
-        .start())
+    .shutdown(ShutdownSource::None)
     .start()
     .await
```

### Removed constructors when there is a public builder ([PR #1487](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1487))

Many types in the Router API can be constructed with the builder pattern.
We use the [`buildstructor`](https://crates.io/crates/buildstructor) crate
to auto-generate builder boilerplate based on the parameters of a constructor.
These constructors have been made private so that users must go through the builder instead,
which will allow us to add parameters in the future without a breaking API change.
If you were using one of these constructors, the migration generally looks like this:

```diff
-apollo_router::graphql::Error::new(m, vec![l], Some(p), Default::default())
+apollo_router::graphql::Error::build()
+    .message(m)
+    .location(l)
+    .path(p)
+    .build()
```

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1487

### Removed deprecated type aliases ([PR #1487](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1487))

A few versions ago, some types were moved from the crate root to a new `graphql` module.
To help the transition, type aliases were left at the old location with a deprecation warning.
These aliases are now removed and remaining imports must be changed to the new locations:

```diff
-use apollo_router::Error;
-use apollo_router::Request;
-use apollo_router::Response;
+use apollo_router::graphql::Error;
+use apollo_router::graphql::Request;
+use apollo_router::graphql::Response;
```

Alternatively, import the module with `use apollo_router::graphql`
then use qualified paths such as `graphql::Request`.
This can help disambiguate when multiple types share a name.

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1487

### `RouterRequest::fake_builder` defaults to `Content-Type: application/json` ([PR #1487](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1487))

`apollo_router::services::RouterRequest` has a builder for creating a ‚Äúfake‚Äù request during tests.
When no `Content-Type` header is specified, this builder will now default to `application/json`.
This will help tests where a request goes through mandatory plugins, including CSRF protection,
which makes the request be accepted by CSRF protection.

If a test requires a request specifically *without* a `Content-Type` header,
this default can be removed from a `RouterRequest` after building it:

```rust
let mut router_request = RouterRequest::fake_builder().build();
router_request.originating_request.headers_mut().remove("content-type");
```

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1487

### Plugins return a `service` to create custom endpoints ([Issue #1481](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1481))

Rust plugins can implement the `Plugin::custom_endpoint` trait method
to handle non-GraphQL HTTP requests.

Previously, the return type of this method was `Option<apollo_router::plugin::Handler>`,
where a `Handler` could be created with:

```rust
impl Handler {
    pub fn new(service: tower::util::BoxService<
        apollo_router::http_ext::Request<bytes::Bytes>,
        apollo_router::http_ext::Response<bytes::Bytes>,
        tower::BoxError
    >) -> Self {/* ‚Ä¶ */}
}
```

`Handler` has been removed from the public API and plugins now return a `BoxService` directly.
Additionally, the type for HTTP request and response bodies was changed
from `bytes::Bytes` to `hyper::Body` which is more flexible and is compatible with streams (which are necessary in future versions of the Router).

The changes needed if using custom endpoints are:

* Replace `Handler::new(service)` with `service`
* To read the full request body,
  use [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html)
  or [`hyper::body::aggregate`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.aggregate.html).
* A response `Body` can be created through conversion traits from various types.
  For example: `"string".into()`

### rhai logging functions now accept Dynamic parameters ([PR #1521](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1521))

Prior to this change, rhai logging functions worked with string parameters. This change means that any valid rhai object
may now be passed as a logging parameter.

### Reduce initial memory footprint by lazily populating introspection query cache ([Issue #1517](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1517))

In an early alpha release of the Router, we only executed certain "known" introspection queries because of prior technical constraints that prohibited us from doing something more flexible.  Because the set of introspection queries was "known", it made sense to cache them.

As of https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/802, this special-casing is (thankfully) no longer necessary and we no longer need to _know_ (and constrain!) the introspection queries that the Router supports.

We could have kept caching those "known" queries, however we were finding that the resulting cache size was quite large and making the Router's minimum memory footprint larger than need be since we were caching many introspection results which the Router instance would never encounter.

This change removes the cache entirely and allows introspection queries served by the Router to merely be lazily calculated and cached on-demand, thereby reducing the initial memory footprint.  Disabling introspection entirely will prevent any use of this cache since no introspection will be possible.

### Expose query plan in extensions of GraphQL response (experimental) ([PR #1470](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1470))

When enabled in configuration, it is now possible to expose the query plan in the GraphQL response `extensions`. This is only experimental at the moment, and we plan to integrate it into an upcoming version of Apollo Studio.  Currently, no documentation is available.

### Add support of global rate limit and timeout. [PR #1347](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1347)

Additions to the traffic shaping plugin:
- **Global rate limit** - If you want to rate limit requests to subgraphs or to the router itself.
- **Timeout**: - Set a timeout to subgraphs and router requests.

```yaml
traffic_shaping:
  router: # Rules applied to requests from clients to the router
    global_rate_limit: # Accept a maximum of 10 requests per 5 secs. Excess requests must be rejected.
      capacity: 10
      interval: 5s # Value in milliseconds must be greater than 0 and less than the max of a 64-bit integer (2^64-1).
    timeout: 50s # If a request to the router takes more than 50secs then cancel the request (30 sec by default)
  subgraphs: # Rules applied to requests from the router to individual subgraphs
    products:
      global_rate_limit: # Accept a maximum of 10 requests per 5 secs from the router. Excess requests must be rejected.
        capacity: 10
        interval: 5s # Value in milliseconds must be greater than 0 and less than the max of a 64-bit integer (2^64-1).
      timeout: 50s # If a request to the subgraph 'products' takes more than 50secs then cancel the request (30 sec by default)

### Explicit `shutdown` for `RouterHttpServer` handle ([PR #1487](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1487))

If you explicitly create a `RouterHttpServer` handle,
dropping it while the server is running instructs the server shut down gracefuly.
However with the handle dropped, there is no way to wait for shutdown to end
or check that it went without error.
Instead, the new `shutdown` async method can be called explicitly
to obtain a `Result`:

```diff
 use RouterHttpServer;
 let server = RouterHttpServer::builder().schema("schema").start();
 // ‚Ä¶
-drop(server);
+server.shutdown().await.unwrap();
```

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1487

### Added `apollo_router::TestHarness` ([PR #1487](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1487))

This is a builder for the part of an Apollo Router that handles GraphQL requests,
as a `tower::Service`.
This allows tests, benchmarks, etc
to manipulate request and response objects in memory without going over the network.
See the API documentation for an example. (It can be built with `cargo doc --open`.)

### Introduce `map_deferred_response` method for deferred responses ([PR #1501](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1501))

The `map_deferred_response` method is now available for the router service and execution
service in Rhai. When using the `@defer` directive, we get the data in a serie of graphql
responses. The first one is available with the `map_response` method, where the HTTP headers
and the response body can be modified. The following responses are available through
`map_deferred_response`, which only has access to the response body.

## üêõ Fixes

### Return HTTP status code 400 when `variables` validation fails ([Issue #1403](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1403))

Failure to validate out-of-band `variables` against both the `query` and the corresponding schema will now result in an HTTP status code of 400 being returned to the client.  This instructs the client not to bother retrying without changing something about what it previously sent since subsequent retries would just fail validation again and again.

### Accept `SIGTERM` as shutdown signal ([PR #1497](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1497))

This will make containers stop faster as they will not have to wait until a `SIGKILL` to stop the router (which generally comes several seconds later).

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1497

### Set the response `path` for deferred responses ([PR #1529](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1529))

Some GraphQL clients rely on the response `path` to find out which
fragment created a deferred response, and generate code that checks the
type of the value at that path.
Previously the router was generating a value that starts at the root
for every deferred response. Now it checks the `path` returned by the query
plan execution and creates a response for each value that matches that
path.
In particular, for deferred fragments on an object inside an array, it
will create a separate response for each element of the array.

### Support the incremental response field ([PR #1551](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1551))

Recent changes in the `@defer` specification now mandate that the deferred responses are transmitted
as an array in the new `incremental` field of the JSON response.

### Landing page: Remove unsanitized example input

The default landing page contained HTML to display a sample `curl` command which is made visible if the full landing page bundle could not be fetched from Apollo's CDN. The server's URL is directly interpolated into this command inside the browser from `window.location.href`. On some older browsers such as IE11, this value is not URI-encoded. On such browsers, opening a malicious URL pointing at an Apollo Router could cause execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript. In this release, the fallback page does not display a `curl` command.

More details are available at the [security advisory](https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-p5q6-hhww-f999).

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### CORS: Deprecate newly-added `allow_any_header` option and return to previous behavior ([PR #1480](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1480))

We've re-considered and reverted changes we shipped in the last release with regards to how we handle the [`Access-Control-Request-Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Request-Headers) *request* header and its corresponding [`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) response header.  We've reverted to the previous releases' behavior, including the removal of the recently-added `allow_any_header` option.

The previous default behavior was to **reflect** the client's `Access-Control-Request-Headers` request header values back in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header.  This previous behavior is in fact a common default behavior in other CORS libraries as well, including the [`cors`](https://npm.im/cors) Node.js package and we think it's worth keeping as it was previously, rather than requiring users to specify `allow_any_header` for the _majority_ of use cases.  We believe this to be a safe and secure default that is also more user-friendly.

It is not typically necessary to change this default behavior, but if you wish to allow a more specific set of headers, you can disable the default header reflection and specify a list of headers using the `allow_headers` option, which will allow only those headers in negotiating a response:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
server:
  cors:
    allow_any_origin: true
    # Including this `allow_headers` isn't typically necessary (can be removed) but
    # will *restrict* the permitted Access-Control-Allow-Headers response values.
    allow_headers:
      - Content-Type
      - Authorization
      - x-my-custom-header
```

### Reference-counting for the schema string given to plugins ([PR #1462](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1462))

The type of the `supergraph_sdl` field of the `apollo_router::plugin::PluginInit` struct
was changed from `String` to `Arc<String>`.
This reduces the number of copies of this string we keep in memory, as schemas can get large.

### Modify the plugin `new` method to pass an initialisation structure ([PR #1446](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1446))

This change alters the `new` method for plugins to pass a `PluginInit` struct.

We are making this change so that we can pass more information during plugin startup. The first change is that in addition to passing
the plugin configuration, we are now also passing the router supergraph sdl (Schema Definition Language) as a string.

There is a new example (`supergraph_sdl`) which illustrates how to use this new capability.

### Remove the generic stream type from `RouterResponse` and `ExecutionResponse` ([PR #1420](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1420))

* `RouterResponse<BoxStream<'static, Response>>` -> `RouterResponse`
* `ExecutionResponse<BoxStream<'static, Response>>` -> `ExecutionResponse`

### Remove the HTTP request from `QueryPlannerRequest` ([PR #1439](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1439))

The content of `QueryPlannerRequest` is used as argument to the query planner and as a cache key,
so it should not change depending on the variables or HTTP headers.

### Change `PluggableRouterServiceBuilder` methods ([PR #1437](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1437))

`with_naive_introspection` and `with_defer_support` where two parameter-less methods
of this builder that enabled boolean configuration flags.
They have been removed and replaced by `with_configuration`
which takes `Arc<apollo_router::Configuration>`.
A `Configuration` value can be created from various formats by deserializing with `serde`.
The removed methods correspond to `server.introspection` and `server.experimental_defer_support`
configuration keys respectively.

### Changes to the `SchemaKind` enum ([PR #1437](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1437))

The `Instance` variant is replaced with a variant named `String` that contains‚Ä¶
a `String` instead of `Box<apollo_router::Schema>`,
so you no longer need to parse the schema before giving it to the router.
Similarly, the `Stream` variant now contains a stream of `String`s
instead of a stream of already-parsed `Schema`s.

### `Schema` no longer implements `FromStr` ([PR #1437](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1437))

This means that `str.parse::<apollo_router::Schema>()` is no longer available.
If you still need a parsed `Schema` (see above),
use `apollo_router::Schema(str, &configuration)` instead.
To use the default `apollo_router::Configuration`
you can call `apollo_router::Schema(str, &Default::default())`.

### Configure Regex based CORS rules ([PR #1444](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1444))

The router now supports regex based CORS rules, as explained in the [docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/cors)
It also supports the `allow_any_header` setting that will mirror client's requested headers.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
server:
  cors:
    match_origins:
      - "https://([a-z0-9]+[.])*api[.]example[.]com" # any host that uses https and ends with .api.example.com
    allow_any_header: true # mirror client's headers
```

The default CORS headers configuration of the router allows `content-type`, `apollographql-client-version` and `apollographql-client-name`.

### Add support of error section in telemetry to add custom attributes ([PR #1443](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1443))

The telemetry is now able to hook at the error stage if router or a subgraph is returning an error. Here is an example of configuration:

```yaml

    common:
      attributes:
        subgraph:
          all:

              include_messages: true # Will include the error message in a message attribute
              extensions: # Include extension data
                - name: subgraph_error_extended_type # Name of the attribute

### Experimental support for the `@defer` directive ([PR #1182](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1182))

The router can now understand the `@defer` directive, used to tag parts of a query so the response is split into
multiple parts that are sent one by one.

:warning: *this is still experimental and not fit for production use yet*

To activate it, add this option to the configuration file:

### Rewrite the caching API ([PR #1281](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1281))

This introduces a new asynchronous caching API that opens the way to multi level caching (in memory and
database). The API revolves around an `Entry` structure that allows query deduplication and lets the
client decide how to generate the value to cache, instead of a complicated delegate system inside the
cache.

### A Rhai error instead of a Rust panic ([PR #1414 https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1414))

### Move `experimental.rhai` out of `experimental` ([PR #1365](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1365))

You will need to update your YAML configuration file to use the correct name for `rhai` plugin.

```diff
- plugins:
-   experimental.rhai:
-     filename: /path/to/myfile.rhai
+ rhai:
+   scripts: /path/to/directory/containing/all/my/rhai/scripts (./scripts by default)
+   main: <name of main script to execute> (main.rhai by default)
```

You can now modularise your rhai code. Rather than specifying a path to a filename containing your rhai code, the rhai plugin will now attempt to execute the script specified via `main`. If modules are imported, the rhai plugin will search for those modules in the `scripts` directory. for more details about how rhai makes use of modules, look at [the rhai documentation](https://rhai.rs/book/ref/modules/import.html).

The simplest migration will be to set `scripts` to the directory containing your `myfile.rhai` and to rename your `myfile.rhai` to `main.rhai`.

the `Plugin::*_service()` methods were taking a `&mut self` as argument, but since

then allows us to move from Buffer to service factories for the query
planner, execution and subgraph services.

* Many items have been removed from the public API and made private.
  If you were relying on these previously-public methods and find that they are no longer available, please open an issue with your use case so we can consider how we want to re-introduce them.

* Many re-exports have been removed.
  Most notably from the crate root and all of the `prelude` modules.
  These items now need to be imported from another location instead,
  most often the module that defines them.

* Some items have moved and need to be imported from a new location.

For example, here are the changes made to `examples/add-timestamp-header/src/main.rs`:

### Entry point improvements ([PR #1227](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1227)) ([PR #1234](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1234)) ([PR #1239](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1239)), [PR #1263](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1263))

The interfaces around the entry point have been improved for naming consistency and to enable reuse when customization is required.
Most users will continue to use:
```rust
apollo_router::main()
```

However, if you want to specify extra customization to configuration/schema/shutdown then you may use `Executable::builder()` to override behavior.

```rust
use apollo_router::Executable;
Executable::builder()
  .router_builder_fn(|configuration, schema| ...) // Optional
  .start().await?
```

Migration tips:
* Calls to `ApolloRouterBuilder::default()` should be migrated to `ApolloRouter::builder`.
* `FederatedServerHandle` has been renamed to `ApolloRouterHandle`.
* The ability to supply your own `RouterServiceFactory` has been removed.
* `StateListener`. This made the internal state machine unnecessarily complex. `listen_address()` remains on `ApolloRouterHandle`.
* `FederatedServerHandle::shutdown()` has been removed. Instead, dropping `ApolloRouterHandle` will cause the router to shutdown.
* `FederatedServerHandle::ready()` has been renamed to `FederatedServerHandle::listen_address()`, it will return the address when the router is ready to serve requests.
* `FederatedServerError` has been renamed to `ApolloRouterError`.
* `main_rt` should be migrated to `Executable::builder()`

### Non-GraphQL response body variants removed from `RouterResponse` ([PR #1307](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1307), [PR #1328](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1328))

The `ResponseBody` enum has been removed.
It had variants for GraphQL and non-GraphQL responses.

It was used:

* In `RouterResponse` which now uses `apollo_router::graphql::Response` instead
* In `Handler` for plugin custom endpoints which now uses `bytes::Bytes` instead

Various type signatures will need changes such as:

```diff
- RouterResponse<BoxStream<'static, ResponseBody>>
+ RouterResponse<BoxStream<'static, graphql::Response>>
```

Necessary code changes might look like:

```diff
- return ResponseBody::GraphQL(response);
+ return response;
```
```diff
- if let ResponseBody::GraphQL(graphql_response) = res {
-     assert_eq!(&graphql_response.errors[0], expected_error);
- } else {
-     panic!("expected a graphql response");
- }
+ assert_eq!(&res.errors[0], expected_error);
```

### Fixed control flow in helm chart for volume mounts & environment variables ([PR #1283](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1283))

You will now be able to actually use the helm chart without being on a managed graph.

### Fail when unknown fields are encountered in configuration ([PR #1278](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1278))

Now if you add an unknown configuration field at the root of your configuration file it will return an error, rather than silently continuing with un-recognized options.

## üöÄ Features

### Allow custom subgraph-specific attributes to be added to emitted metrics ([PR #1300](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1300))

Previously, it was only possible to add custom attributes from headers which the router received from the external GraphQL client. Now, you are able to add custom attributes coming from both the headers and the body of either the Router's or the Subgraph's router request or response. You also have the ability to add an attributes from the context. For example:

```yaml
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      attributes:
        router:
          static:
            - name: "version"
              value: "v1.0.0"
          request:
            header:
              - named: "content-type"
                rename: "payload_type"
                default: "application/json"
              - named: "x-custom-header-to-add"
          response:
            body:
              # Take element from the Router's JSON response body router located at a specific path
              - path: .errors[0].extensions.status
                name: error_from_body
          context:
            # Take element from the context within plugin chains and add it in attributes
            - named: my_key
        subgraph:
          all:
            static:
              # Always insert this static value on all metrics for ALL Subgraphs
              - name: kind
                value: subgraph_request
          subgraphs:
            # Apply these only for the SPECIFIC subgraph named `my_subgraph_name`
            my_subgraph_name:
              request:
                header:
                  - named: "x-custom-header"
                body:
                  # Take element from the request body of the router located at this path (here it's the query)
                  - path: .query
                    name: query

### Add support for modifying variables from a plugin ([PR #1257](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1257))

Previously, it was not possible to modify variables in a `Request` from a plugin. This is now supported via both Rust and Rhai plugins.

## üêõ Fixes

### Extend fix for compression support to include the DIY Dockerfiles ([PR #1352](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1352))

Compression support is now shown in the DIY Dockerfiles, as a followup to [PR #1279](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1279).

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1352

### Improve URL parsing in endpoint configuration ([PR #1341](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1341))

Specifying an endpoint in this form '127.0.0.1:431' resulted in an error: 'relative URL without a base'. The fix enhances the URL parsing logic to check for these errors and re-parses with a default scheme 'http://' so that parsing succeeds.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1341

### Improve configuration validation and environment expansion ([PR #1331](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1331))

Environment expansion now covers the entire configuration file, and supports non-string types.

This means that it is now possible to use environment variables in the `server` section of the YAML configuration, including numeric and boolean fields.

Environment variables will always be shown in their original form within error messages to prevent leakage of secrets.

These changes allow more of the configuration file to be validated via JSON-schema, as previously we just skipped errors where fields contained environment variables.

By [@bryncooke](https://github.com/bryncooke) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1331

### Fix input coercion for a list ([PR #1327](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1327))

The router is now following coercion rules for lists in accordance with [the GraphQL specification](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Type-System.List). In particular, this fixes the case when an input type of `[Int]` with only `1` provided as a value will now be properly coerced to `[1]`.

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1327

### Returns HTTP 400 Bad Request, rather than a 500, when hitting a query planning error ([PR #1321](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1321))

A query planning error cannot be retried, so this error code more correctly matches the failure mode and indicates to the client that it should not be retried without changing the request.

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1321

### Re-enable the subgraph error-redaction functionality ([PR #1317](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1317))

In a re-factoring the `include_subgraph_errors` plugin was disabled. This meant that subgraph error handling was not working as intended. This change re-enables it and improves the functionality with additional logging. As part of the fix, the plugin initialization mechanism was improved to ensure that plugins start in the required sequence.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1317

### Restrict static introspection to only `__schema` and `__type` ([PR #1299](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1299))
Queries with selected field names starting with `__` are recognized as introspection queries. This includes `__schema`, `__type` and `__typename`. However, `__typename` is introspection at query time which is different from `__schema` and `__type` because two of the later can be answered with queries with empty input variables. This change will restrict introspection to only `__schema` and `__type`.

By [@dingxiangfei2009](https://github.com/dingxiangfei2009) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1299

### Fix plugin scaffolding support ([PR #1293](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1293))

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1293

### Support introspection object types ([PR #1240](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1240))

Introspection queries can use a set of object types defined in the specification. The query parsing code was not recognizing them, resulting in some introspection queries not working.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1240

### Update the scaffold template so it works with streams ([#1247](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1247))

Release v0.9.4 changed the way we deal with `Response` objects, which can now be streams. The scaffold template now generates plugins that are compatible with this new Plugin API.

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1248

### Fix fragment selection on interfaces ([PR #1295](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1295))

Fragments type conditions were not being checked correctly on interfaces, resulting in invalid null fields added to the response or valid data being incorrectly `null`-ified.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1295

### Fix fragment selection on queries ([PR #1296](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1296))

The schema object can specify objects for queries, mutations or subscriptions that are not named `Query`, `Mutation` or `Subscription`. Response formatting now supports it.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1296

### Fix fragment selection on unions ([PR #1346](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1346))

Fragments type conditions were not checked correctly on unions, resulting in data being absent.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1346

### Reduce `poll_ready` calls in query deduplication ([PR #1350](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1350))

The query deduplication service was making assumptions on the underlying service's behaviour, which could result in subgraph services panicking.

### Move `experimental.traffic_shaping` out of `experimental` [PR #1229](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1229)
You will need to update your YAML configuration file to use the correct name for `traffic_shaping` plugin.

```diff
- plugins:
-   experimental.traffic_shaping:
-     variables_deduplication: true # Enable the variables deduplication optimization
-     all:

### Rhai plugin `request.sub_headers` renamed to `request.subgraph.headers` [PR #1261](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1261)

Rhai scripts previously supported the `request.sub_headers` attribute so that subgraph request headers could be
accessed. This is now replaced with an extended interface for subgraph requests:

```
request.subgraph.headers
request.subgraph.body.query
request.subgraph.body.operation_name
request.subgraph.body.variables
request.subgraph.body.extensions
request.subgraph.uri.host
request.subgraph.uri.path

## üöÄ Features

### Add support of compression [PR #1229](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1229)
Add support of request and response compression for the router and all subgraphs. The router is now able to handle `Content-Encoding` and `Accept-Encoding` headers properly. Supported algorithms are `gzip`, `br`, `deflate`.
You can also enable compression on subgraphs requests and responses by updating the `traffic_shaping` configuration:

```yaml
traffic_shaping:
  all:
    compression: br # Enable brotli compression for all subgraphs
  subgraphs:
    products:
      compression: gzip # Enable gzip compression only for subgraph products

Add support of multiple uplink URLs with a comma-separated list in `APOLLO_UPLINK_ENDPOINTS` and for `--apollo-uplink-endpoints`

Example:
```bash
export APOLLO_UPLINK_ENDPOINTS="https://aws.uplink.api.apollographql.com/, https://uplink.api.apollographql.com/"

### Add support for adding extra environment variables and volumes to helm chart [PR #1245](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1245)
You can mount your `supergraph.yaml` into the helm deployment via configmap. Using [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) to generate your configmap from your supergraph.yaml is suggested.

Example configmap.yaml snippet:
```yaml
supergraph.yaml:
    server:
        listen: 0.0.0.0:80
```

Example helm config:
```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: APOLLO_ROUTER_SUPERGRAPH_PATH
    value: /etc/apollo/supergraph.yaml
    # sets router log level to debug
  - name: APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG
    value: debug

### Create the `ExecutionResponse` after the primary response was generated ([PR #1260](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1260))
The `@defer` preliminary work had a surprising side effect: when using methods like `RouterResponse::map_response`, they were
executed before the subgraph responses were received, because they work on the stream of responses.
This PR goes back to the previous behaviour by awaiting the primary response before creating the `ExecutionResponse`.

# [0.9.4] - 2022-06-14

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó


### Groundwork for `@defer` support ([PR #1175](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1175)[PR #1206](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1206))
To prepare for the implementation of the `@defer` directive, the `ExecutionResponse`  and `RouterResponse` types now carry a stream of responses instead of a unique response. For now that stream contains only one item, so there is no change in behaviour. However, the Plugin trait changed to accomodate this, so a couple of steps are required to migrate your plugin so that it is compatible with versions of the router >= v0.9.4:

- Add a dependency to futures in your Cargo.toml:

```diff
+futures = "0.3.21"
```

- Import `BoxStream`, and if your Plugin defines a `router_service` behavior, import `ResponseBody`:

```diff
+ use futures::stream::BoxStream;
+ use apollo_router::ResponseBody;
```

- Update the `router_service` and the `execution_service` sections of your Plugin (if applicable):

```diff
      fn router_service(
         &mut self,
-        service: BoxService<RouterRequest, RouterResponse, BoxError>,

+            .next_response()
+            .await
+            .expect("couldn't get primary response");
+
+        if let ResponseBody::GraphQL(graphql) = first_response {
             assert!(graphql.data.is_some());
         } else {
             panic!("expected graphql response")
         }

+        // You could keep calling result.next_response() until it yields None if you are expexting more parts.
+        assert!(result.next_response().await.is_none());
         Ok(())

### Fix input validation rules ([PR #1211](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1211))
The GraphQL specification provides two sets of coercion / validation rules, depending on whether we're dealing with inputs or outputs.
We have added validation rules for specified input validations which were not previously implemented.
This is a breaking change since slightly invalid input may have validated before but will now be guarded by newly-introduced validation rules.

## üöÄ Features
### Add trace logs for parsing recursion consumption ([PR #1222](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1222))
The `apollo-parser` package now implements recursion limits which can be examined after the parsing phase. The router logs these
out at `trace` level. You can see them in your logs by searching for "`recursion_limit`". For example, when using JSON logging
and using `jq` to filter the output:

```
router -s ../graphql/supergraph.graphql -c ./router.yaml --log trace | jq -c '. | select(.fields.message == "recursion limit data")'
{"timestamp":"2022-06-10T15:01:02.213447Z","level":"TRACE","fields":{"message":"recursion limit data","recursion_limit":"recursion limit: 4096, high: 0"},"target":"apollo_router::spec::schema"}
{"timestamp":"2022-06-10T15:01:02.261092Z","level":"TRACE","fields":{"message":"recursion limit data","recursion_limit":"recursion limit: 4096, high: 0"},"target":"apollo_router::spec::schema"}
{"timestamp":"2022-06-10T15:01:07.642977Z","level":"TRACE","fields":{"message":"recursion limit data","recursion_limit":"recursion limit: 4096, high: 4"},"target":"apollo_router::spec::query"}
```

This example output shows that the maximum recursion limit is 4096 and that the query we processed caused us to recurse 4 times.

### Helm chart now has the option to use an existing secrets for API key [PR #1196](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1196)

This change allows the use of an already existing secret for the graph API key.

```
helm install --set router.managedFederation.existingSecret="my-secret-name" <etc...>`
```

### Add iterators to `Context` ([PR #1202](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1202))
Context can now be iterated over, with two new methods:

 - `iter()`
 - `iter_mut()`

These implementations lean heavily on an underlying [`DashMap`](https://docs.rs/dashmap/5.3.4/dashmap/struct.DashMap.html#method.iter) implemetation, so refer to its documentation for more usage details.

      attributes:
        static:
          - name: "version"
            value: "v1.0.0"

### Fix CORS configuration to eliminate runtime panic on misconfiguration ([PR #1197](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1197))

Previously, it was possible to specify a CORS configuration which was syntactically valid, but which could not be enforced at runtime.  For example, consider the following *invalid* configuration where the `allow_any_origin` and `allow_credentials` parameters are inherantly incompatible with each other (per the CORS specification):

```yaml
server:
  cors:
    allow_any_origin: true
    allow_credentials: true
```

Previously, this would result in a runtime panic. The router will now detect this kind of misconfiguration and report the error without panicking.

### Remove the agent endpoint configuration for Zipkin [PR #1025](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1025)

Zipkin only supports `endpoint` URL configuration rather than `endpoint` within `collector`, this means Zipkin configuration changes from:

```yaml
telemetry:
  tracing:
    trace_config:
      service_name: router
    zipkin:
      collector:
        endpoint: default

      service_name: router
    zipkin:
      endpoint: default
```

### CSRF Protection is enabled by default [PR #1006](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1006)

A [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection plugin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF) is now enabled by default.

This means [simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests) will be rejected from now on, since they represent security risks without the correct CSRF protections in place.

The plugin can be customized as explained in the [CORS and CSRF example](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples/cors-and-csrf/custom-headers.router.yaml).

### CORS default behavior update [PR #1006](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1006)

The CORS `allow_headers` default behavior has changed from its previous configuration.

The Router will now _reflect_ the values received in the [`Access-Control-Request-Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Request-Headers) header, rather than only allowing `Content-Type`, `apollographql-client-name` and `apollographql-client-version` as it did previously.

This change loosens the CORS-related headers restrictions, so it shouldn't have any impact on your setup.

## üöÄ Features

### CSRF Protection [PR #1006](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1006)

[Documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/cors/) will be updated soon!

### Helm chart now supports prometheus metrics [PR #1005](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1005)
The router has supported exporting prometheus metrics for a while. This change updates our helm chart to enable router deployment prometheus metrics.

- Subgraph services are now identified by name.

There is more documentation about how to use the various rhai interfaces to the Router and we now have _six_ [examples of rhai scripts](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples) (look for examples prefixed with `rhai-`) doing various request and response manipulations!

### Configuration for Jaeger/Zipkin agent requires an URL instead of a socket address [PR #1018](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1018)
The router now supports URLs for a Jaeger **or** Zipkin agent allowing configuration as follows in this `jaeger` example:

```yaml
telemetry:

      service_name: router
    jaeger:
      agent:
        endpoint: jaeger:14268

### Improvements to Apollo Studio reporting [PR #1020](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1020), [PR #1037](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1037)

This architectural change, which moves the location that we do aggregations internally in the Router, allows us to move towards full reporting functionality.  It shouldn't affect most users.

### Field usage reporting is now reported against the correct schema [PR #1043](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1043)

When using Managed Federation, we now report usage identified by the schema it was processed on, improving reporting in Apollo Studio.

### Check that an object's `__typename` is part of the schema [PR #1033](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1033)

In case a subgraph returns an object with a `__typename` field referring to a type that is not in the API schema, as is the case when using the `@inaccessible` directive on object types, the requested object tree is now replaced with a `null` value in order to conform with the API schema.  This improves our behavior with the recently launched Contracts feature from Apollo Studio.

We've adjusted the environment variables that the Router supports to be consistently prefixed with `APOLLO_` and to remove some inconsistencies in their previous naming.

You'll need to adjust to the new environment variable names, as follows:

- `RUST_LOG` -> `APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG`
- `CONFIGURATION_PATH` -> `APOLLO_ROUTER_CONFIG_PATH`
- `SUPERGRAPH_PATH` -> `APOLLO_ROUTER_SUPERGRAPH_PATH`
- `ROUTER_HOT_RELOAD` -> `APOLLO_ROUTER_HOT_RELOAD`
- `APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT` -> `APOLLO_UPLINK_ENDPOINTS`
- `APOLLO_SCHEMA_POLL_INTERVAL`-> `APOLLO_UPLINK_POLL_INTERVAL`

In addition, the following command line flags have changed:
- `--apollo-schema-config-delivery-endpoint` -> `--apollo-uplink-url`
- `--apollo-schema-poll-interval` -> `--apollo-uplink-poll-interval`

### Configurable URL request path [PR #976](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/976)

The default router endpoint is now `/` (previously, it was `/graphql`). It's now possible to customize that value by defining an `endpoint` in your Router configuration file's `server` section:

```yaml
server:
  # The socket address and port to listen on
  # Defaults to 127.0.0.1:4000
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
  # Default is /
  endpoint: /graphql
```

If you necessitated the previous behavior (using `/graphql`), you should use the above configuration.

### Do even more with rhai scripts  [PR #971](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/971)

The rhai scripting support in the Router has been re-worked to bring its capabilities closer to that native Rust plugin.  This includes full participation in the service plugin lifecycle and new capabilities like logging support!

See our [`examples`](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples/) directory and [the documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/rhai) for updated examples of how to use the new capabilities.

## üöÄ Features

### Did we already mention doing more with rhai?

It's listed as a breaking change above because it is, but it's worth highlighting that it's now possible to do even more using rhai scripting which previously necessitated writing native Rust plugins and compiling your own binary.

See our [`examples`](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples/) directory and [the documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/rhai) for updated examples of how to use the new capabilities.

### Panics now output to the console [PR #1001](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1001) [PR #1004](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1004)
Previously, panics would get swallowed but are now output to the console/logs.  The use of the Rust-standard environment variables `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` (or `RUST_BACKTRACE=full`) will result in emitting the full backtrace.

### Apollo Studio Usage Reporting [PR #898](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/898)
If you have [enabled telemetry in the Router](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/apollo-telemetry#enabling-usage-reporting), you can now see field usage reporting for your queries by heading to the Fields page for your graph in Apollo Studio.

Learn more about our field usage reporting in the Studio [documentation for field usage](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/metrics/field-usage).

### `PluginTestHarness` [PR #898](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/898)
Added a simple plugin test harness that can provide canned responses to queries. This harness is early in development and the functionality and APIs will probably change.
```rust
 let mut test_harness = PluginTestHarness::builder()
            .plugin(plugin)
            .schema(Canned)
            .build()
            .await?;

let _ = test_harness
    .call(
        RouterRequest::fake_builder()
            .header("name_header", "test_client")
            .header("version_header", "1.0-test")
            .query(query)
            .and_operation_name(operation_name)
            .and_context(context)
            .build()?,
    )
    .await;
```
## üêõ Fixes

### Improve the diagnostics when encountering a configuration error [PR #963](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/963)
In the case of unrecognized properties in your Router's configuration, we will now point you directly to the unrecognized value.  Previously, we pointed to the parent property even if it wasn't the source of the misconfiguration.

### Only allow mutations on HTTP POST requests [PR #975](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/975)
Mutations are now only accepted when using the HTTP POST method.

### Fix incorrectly omitting content of interface's fragment [PR #949](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/949)
The Router now distinguishes between fragments on concrete types and interfaces.
If an interface is encountered and  `__typename` is being queried, we now check that the returned type implements the interface.

### Set the service name if not specified in config or environment [PR #960](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/960)
The router now sets `router` as the default service name in OpenTelemetry traces, along with `process.executable_name`.   This can be adjusted through the configuration file or environment variables.

### Accept an endpoint URL without scheme for telemetry [PR #964](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/964)

Endpoint configuration for Datadog and OTLP take a URL as argument, but was incorrectly recognizing addresses of the format "host:port" (i.e., without a scheme, like `grpc://`) as the wrong protocol.  This has been corrected!

### Stricter application of `@inaccessible` [PR #985](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/985)

The Router's query planner has been updated to v2.0.2 and stricter behavior for the `@inaccessible` directive.  This also fully supports the new [Apollo Studio Contracts](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/contracts/) feature which just went generally available (GA).

### Impose recursion limits on selection processing [PR #995](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/995)

We now limit operations to a depth of 512 to prevent cycles.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Use official SPDX license identifier for Elastic License v2 (ELv2) [Issue #418](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/418)

Rather than pointing to our `LICENSE` file, we now use the `Elastic-2.0` SPDX license identifier to indicate that a particular component is governed by the Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2).  This should facilitate automated compatibility with licensing tools which assist with compliance.

## üìö Documentation

### Router startup messaging now includes version and license notice  [PR #986](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/986)

We now display the version of the Router at startup, along with clarity that the Router is licensed under [ELv2](https://go.apollo.dev/elv2).

# [v0.1.0-preview.7] - 2022-05-04
## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Plugin utilities cleanup [PR #819](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/819), [PR #908](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/908)
Utilities around creating Request and Response structures have been migrated to builders.

Migration:
* `plugin_utils::RouterRequest::builder()`->`RouterRequest::fake_builder()`
* `plugin_utils::RouterResponse::builder()`->`RouterResponse::fake_builder()`

In addition, the `plugin_utils` module has been removed. Mock service functionality has been migrated to `plugin::utils::test`.

### Layer cleanup [PR #950](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/950)
Reusable layers have all been moved to `apollo_router_core::layers`. In particular the `checkpoint_*` layers have been moved from the `plugins` module.
`async_checkpoint` has been renamed to `checkpoint_async` for consistency with Tower.
Layers that were internal to our execution pipeline have been moved and made private to the crate.

### Plugin API changes [PR #855](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/855)
Previously the Plugin trait has three lifecycle hooks: new, startup, and shutdown.

Startup and shutdown are problematic because:
* Plugin construction happens in new and startup. This means creating in new and populating in startup.
* Startup and shutdown has to be explained to the user.
* Startup and shutdown ordering is delicate.

The lifecycle now looks like this:
1. `new`
2. `activate`
3. `drop`

Users can migrate their plugins using the following:
* `Plugin#startup`->`Plugin#new`
* `Plugin#shutdown`->`Drop#drop`

In addition, the `activate` lifecycle hook is now not marked as deprecated, and users are free to use it.

## üöÄ Features

### Add SpanKind and SpanStatusCode to follow the opentelemetry spec [PR #925](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/925)
Spans now contains [`otel.kind`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#spankind) and [`otel.status_code`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#set-status) attributes when needed to follow the opentelemtry spec .

###  Configurable client identification headers [PR #850](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/850)
The router uses the HTTP headers `apollographql-client-name` and `apollographql-client-version` to identify clients in Studio telemetry. Those headers can now be overriden in the configuration:
```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  apollo:
    # Header identifying the client name. defaults to apollographql-client-name
    client_name_header: <custom_client_header_name>
    # Header identifying the client version. defaults to apollographql-client-version
    client_version_header: <custom_version_header_name>
```

## üêõ Fixes
### Fields in the root selection set of a query are now correctly skipped and included [PR #931](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/931)
The `@skip` and `@include` directives are now executed for the fields in the root selection set.

### Configuration errors on hot-reload are output [PR #850](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/850)
If a configuration file had errors on reload these were silently swallowed. These are now added to the logs.

### Telemetry spans are no longer created for healthcheck requests [PR #938](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/938)
Telemetry spans where previously being created for the healthcheck requests which was creating noisy telemetry for users.

### Dockerfile now allows overriding of `CONFIGURATION_PATH` [PR #948](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/948)
Previously `CONFIGURATION_PATH` could not be used to override the config location as it was being passed by command line arg.

## üõ† Maintenance
### Upgrade `test-span` to display more children spans in our snapshots [PR #942](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/942)
Previously in test-span before the fix [introduced here](https://github.com/apollographql/test-span/pull/13) we were filtering too aggressively. So if we wanted to snapshot all `DEBUG` level if we encountered a `TRACE` span which had `DEBUG` children then these children were not snapshotted. It's now fixed and it's more consistent with what we could have/see in jaeger.

### Finalize migration from Warp to Axum [PR #920](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/920)
Adding more tests to be more confident to definitely delete the `warp-server` feature and get rid of `warp`

### End to end integration tests for Jaeger [PR #850](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/850)
Jaeger tracing end to end test including client->router->subgraphs

### Router tracing span cleanup [PR #850](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/850)
Spans generated by the Router are now aligned with plugin services.

### Simplified CI for windows [PR #850](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/850)
All windows processes are spawned via xtask rather than a separate CircleCI stage.

### Enable default feature in graphql_client [PR #905](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/905)
Removing the default feature can cause build issues in plugins.

### Do not remove __typename from the aggregated response [PR #919](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/919)
If the client was explicitely requesting the `__typename` field, it was removed from the aggregated subgraph data, and so was not usable by fragment to check the type.

### Follow the GraphQL spec about Response format [PR #926](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/926)
The response's `data` field can be null or absent depending on conventions that are now followed by the router.

## Add client awareness headers to CORS allowed headers [PR #917](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/917)

The client awareness headers are now added by default to the list of CORS allowed headers, for easier integration of browser based applications. We also document how to override them and update the CORS configuration accordingly.

## Remove unnecessary box in instrumentation layer [PR #940](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/940)

Minor simplification of code to remove boxing during instrumentation.

## üìö Documentation
### Enhanced rust docs ([PR #819](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/819))
Many more rust docs have been added.

### Federation version support page [PR #896](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/896)
Add Federation version support doc page detailing which versions of federation are compiled against versions of the router.

### Improve readme for embedded Router [PR #936](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/936)
Add more details about pros and cons so that users know what they're letting themselves in for.

### Document layers [PR #950](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/950)
Document the notable existing layers and add rust docs for custom layers including basic use cases.

### Restore the health check route [#883](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/883)
Axum rework caused the healthckeck route `/.well-known/apollo/server-health` to change. The route is now restored.

### Correctly flag incoming POST requests [#865](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/865)
A regression happened during our recent switch to Axum that would propagate incoming POST requests as GET requests. Fixed and added regression tests.

### Helm chart for the router [PR #861](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/861)

[Helm](https://helm.sh) support provided by @damienpontifex.

### Line precise error reporting [PR #830](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/782)
The router will make a best effort to give line precise error reporting if the configuration was invalid.
```yaml
1. /telemetry/tracing/trace_config/sampler

telemetry:
  tracing:
    trace_config:
      service_name: router3
      sampler: "0.3"
               ^----- "0.3" is not valid under any of the given schemas
```
### Install experience [PR #820](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/820)

Added an install script that will automatically download and unzip the router into the local directory.
For more info see the quickstart documentation.

## üêõ Fixes

### Fix concurrent query planning [#846](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/846)
The query planner has been reworked to make sure concurrent plan requests will be dispatched to the relevant requester.

### Do not hang when tracing provider was not set as global [#849](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/847)
The telemetry plugin will now Drop cleanly when the Router service stack fails to build.

### Propagate error extensions originating from subgraphs [PR #839](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/839)
Extensions are now propagated following the configuration of the `include_subgraph_error` plugin.

### Telemetry configuration [PR #830](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/830)
Jaeger and Zipkin telemetry config produced JSON schema that was invalid.

### Return a better error when introspection is disabled [PR #751](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/751)
Instead of returning an error coming from the query planner, we are now returning a proper error explaining that the introspection has been disabled.

### Add operation name to subquery fetches [PR #840](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/840)
If present in the query plan fetch node, the operation name will be added to sub-fetches.

### Remove trailing slash from Datadog agent endpoint URL [PR #863](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/863)
Due to the way the endpoint URL is constructed in opentelemetry-datadog, we cannot set the agent endpoint to a URL with a trailing slash.

## üõ† Maintenance
### Configuration files validated [PR #830](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/830)
Router configuration files within the project are now largely validated via unit test.

### Switch web server framework from `warp` to `axum` [PR #751](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/751)
The router is now running by default with an [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/) web server instead of `warp`.

### Improve the way we handle Request with axum [PR #845](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/845) [PR #877](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/877)
Take advantages of new extractors given by `axum`.

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó
- **Telemetry simplification** [PR #782](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/782)

  Telemetry configuration has been reworked to focus exporters rather than OpenTelemetry. Users can focus on what they are trying to integrate with rather than the fact that OpenTelemetry is used in the Apollo Router under the hood.

  ```yaml
  telemetry:
    apollo:
      endpoint:
      apollo_graph_ref:
      apollo_key:
    metrics:
      prometheus:
        enabled: true
    tracing:
      propagation:
        # Propagation is automatically enabled for any exporters that are enabled,
        # but you can enable extras. This is mostly to support otlp and opentracing.
        zipkin: true
        datadog: false
        trace_context: false
        jaeger: false
        baggage: false

      otlp:
        endpoint: default
        protocol: grpc
        http:

      jaeger:
        agent:
          endpoint: default
      datadog:
        endpoint: default
  ```
## üöÄ Features
- **Datadog support** [PR #782](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/782)

  Datadog support has been added via `telemetry` yaml configuration.

- **Yaml env variable expansion** [PR #782](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/782)

  All values in the router configuration outside the `server` section may use environment variable expansion.
  Unix style expansion is used. Either:

  * `${ENV_VAR_NAME}`- Expands to the environment variable `ENV_VAR_NAME`.
  * `${ENV_VAR_NAME:some_default}` - Expands to `ENV_VAR_NAME` or `some_default` if the environment variable did not exist.

  Only values may be expanded (not keys):
  ```yaml {4,8} title="router.yaml"
  example:
    passord: "${MY_PASSWORD}"
  ```
## üêõ Fixes

- **Accept arrays in keys for subgraph joins** [PR #822](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/822)

  The router is now accepting arrays as part of the key joining between subgraphs.


- **Fix value shape on empty subgraph queries** [PR #827](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/827)

  When selecting data for a federated query, if there is no data the router will not perform the subgraph query and will instead return a default value. This value had the wrong shape and was generating an object where the query would expect an array.

## üõ† Maintenance

- **Apollo federation 2.0.0 compatible query planning** [PR#828](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/828)

  Now that Federation 2.0 is available, we have updated the query planner to use the latest release (@apollo/query-planner v2.0.0).


# [v0.1.0-preview.3] - 2022-04-08
## üöÄ Features
- **Add version flag to router** ([PR #805](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/805))

  You can now provider a `--version or -V` flag to the router. It will output version information and terminate.

- **New startup message** ([PR #780](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/780))

  The router startup message was updated with more links to documentation and version information.

- **Add better support of introspection queries** ([PR #802](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/802))

  Before this feature the Router didn't execute all the introspection queries, only a small number of the most common ones were executed. Now it detects if it's an introspection query, tries to fetch it from cache, if it's not in the cache we execute it and put the response in the cache.

- **Add an option to disable the landing page** ([PR #801](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/801))

  By default the router will display a landing page, which could be useful in development. If this is not
  desirable the router can be configured to not display this landing page:
  ```yaml
  server:
    landing_page: false
  ```

- **Add support of metrics in `apollo.telemetry` plugin** ([PR #738](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/738))

  The Router will now compute different metrics you can expose via Prometheus or OTLP exporter.

  Example of configuration to export an endpoint (configured with the path `/plugins/apollo.telemetry/metrics`) with metrics in `Prometheus` format:

  ```yaml
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      exporter:
        prometheus:
          # By setting this endpoint you enable the prometheus exporter
          # All our endpoints exposed by plugins are namespaced by the name of the plugin
          # Then to access to this prometheus endpoint, the full url path will be `/plugins/apollo.telemetry/metrics`
          endpoint: "/metrics"
    ```

- **Add experimental support of `custom_endpoint` method in `Plugin` trait** ([PR #738](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/738))

  The `custom_endpoint` method lets you declare a new endpoint exposed for your plugin. For now it's only accessible for official `apollo.` plugins and for `experimental.`. The return type of this method is a Tower [`Service`]().

- **configurable subgraph error redaction** ([PR #797](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/797))
  By default, subgraph errors are not propagated to the user. This experimental plugin allows messages to be propagated either for all subgraphs or on
  an individual subgraph basis. Individual subgraph configuration overrides the default (all) configuration. The configuration mechanism is similar
  to that used in the `headers` plugin:
  ```yaml
  plugins:
    experimental.include_subgraph_errors:
      all: true
  ```

- **Add a trace level log for subgraph queries** ([PR #808](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/808))

  To debug the query plan execution, we added log messages to print the query plan, and for each subgraph query,
  the operation, variables and response. It can be activated as follows:

  ```
  router -s supergraph.graphql --log info,apollo_router_core::query_planner::log=trace
  ```

## üêõ Fixes
- **Eliminate memory leaks when tasks are cancelled** [PR #758](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/758)

  The deduplication layer could leak memory when queries were cancelled and never retried: leaks were previously cleaned up on the next similar query. Now the leaking data will be deleted right when the query is cancelled

- **Trim the query to better detect an empty query** ([PR #738](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/738))

  Before this fix, if you wrote a query with only whitespaces inside, it wasn't detected as an empty query.

- **Keep the original context in `RouterResponse` when returning an error** ([PR #738](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/738))

  This fix keeps the original http request in `RouterResponse` when there is an error.

- **add a user-agent header to the studio usage ingress submission** ([PR #773](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/773))

  Requests to Studio now identify the router and its version

## üõ† Maintenance
- **A faster Query planner** ([PR #768](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/768))

  We reworked the way query plans are generated before being cached, which lead to a great performance improvement. Moreover, the router is able to make sure the schema is valid at startup and on schema update, before you query it.

- **Xtask improvements** ([PR #604](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/604))

  The command we run locally to make sure tests, lints and compliance-checks pass will now edit the license file and run cargo fmt so you can directly commit it before you open a Pull Request

- **Switch from reqwest to a Tower client for subgraph services** ([PR #769](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/769))

  It results in better performance due to less URL parsing, and now header propagation falls under the apollo_router_core log filter, making it harder to disable accidentally

- **Remove OpenSSL usage** ([PR #783](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/783) and [PR #810](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/810))

  OpenSSL is used for HTTPS clients when connecting to subgraphs or the Studio API. It is now replaced with rustls, which is faster to compile and link

- **Download the Studio protobuf schema during build** ([PR #776](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/776)

  The schema was vendored before, now it is downloaded dynamically during the build process

- **Fix broken benchmarks** ([PR #797](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/797))

  the `apollo-router-benchmarks` project was failing due to changes in the query planner. It is now fixed, and its subgraph mocking code is now available in `apollo-router-core`

## üìö Documentation

- **Document the Plugin and DynPlugin trait** ([PR #800](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/800)

  Those traits are used to extend the router with Rust plugins

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **CORS default Configuration** ([#40](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/40))

  The Router will allow only the https://studio.apollographql.com origin by default, instead of any origin.
  This behavior can still be tweaked in the [YAML configuration](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/cors)

- **Hot reload flag** ([766](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/766))
  The `--watch` (or `-w`) flag that enables hot reload was renamed to `--hr` or `--hot-reload`

## üöÄ Features

- **Hot reload via en environment variable** ([766](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/766))
  You can now use the `ROUTER_HOT_RELOAD=true` environment variable to have the router watch for configuration and schema changes and automatically reload.

- **Container images are now available** ([PR #764](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/764))

  We now build container images More details at:
    https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/router

  You can use the images with docker, for example, as follows:
    e.g.: docker pull ghcr.io/apollographql/router:v0.1.0-preview.1

  The images are based on [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) which is a very constrained image, intended to be secure and small.

  We'll provide release and debug images for each release. The debug image has a busybox shell which can be accessed using (for instance) `--entrypoint=sh`.

  For more details about these images, see the docs.

- **Skip and Include directives in post processing** ([PR #626](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/626))

  The Router now understands the [@skip](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec--skip) and [@include](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec--include) directives in queries, to add or remove fields depending on variables. It works in post processing, by filtering fields after aggregating the subgraph responses.

- **Add an option to deactivate introspection** ([PR #749](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/749))

  While schema introspection is useful in development, we might not want to expose the entire schema in production,
  so the router can be configured to forbid introspection queries as follows:
  ```yaml
  server:
    introspection: false
  ```

## üêõ Fixes
- **Move query dedup to an experimental `traffic_shaping` plugin** ([PR #753](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/753))

  The experimental `traffic_shaping` plugin will be a central location where we can add things such as rate limiting and retry.

- **Remove `hasNext` from our response objects** ([PR #733](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/733))

  `hasNext` is a field in the response that may be used in future to support features such as defer and stream. However, we are some way off supporting this and including it now may break clients. It has been removed.

- **Extend Apollo uplink configurability** ([PR #741](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/741))

  Uplink url and poll interval can now be configured via command line arg and env variable:
  ```bash
    --apollo-schema-config-delivery-endpoint <apollo-schema-config-delivery-endpoint>
      The endpoint polled to fetch the latest supergraph schema [env: APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT=]

    --apollo-schema-poll-interval <apollo-schema-poll-interval>
      The time between polls to Apollo uplink. Minimum 10s [env: APOLLO_SCHEMA_POLL_INTERVAL=]  [default: 10s]
  ```
  In addition, other existing uplink env variables are now also configurable via arg.

- **Make deduplication and caching more robust against cancellation** [PR #752](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/752) [PR #758](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/758)

  Cancelling a request could put the router in an unresponsive state where the deduplication layer or cache would make subgraph requests hang.

- **Relax variables selection for subgraph queries** ([PR #755](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/755))

  Federated subgraph queries relying on partial or invalid data from previous subgraph queries could result in response failures or empty subgraph queries. The router is now more flexible when selecting data from previous queries, while still keeping a correct form for the final response

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **Improvements to telemetry attribute YAML ergonomics** ([PR #729](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/729))

  Trace config YAML ergonomics have been improved. To add additional attributes to your trace information, you can now use the following format:

  ```yaml
        trace_config:
          attributes:
            str: "a"
            int: 1
            float: 1.0
            bool: true
            str_arr:

## üêõ Fixes

- **Log and error message formatting** ([PR #721](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/721))

  Logs and error messages now begin with lower case and do not have trailing punctuation, per Rust conventions.

- **OTLP default service.name and service.namespace** ([PR #722](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/722))

  While the Jaeger YAML configuration would default to `router` for the `service.name` and to `apollo` for the `service.namespace`, it was not the case when using a configuration that utilized OTLP. This lead to an `UNKNOWN_SERVICE` name span in zipkin traces, and difficult to find Jaeger traces.

## üéâ **The Apollo Router has graduated to its Preview phase!** üéâ

For more information on what's expected at this stage, please see our [release stages](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/release-stages/#preview).

## üêõ Fixes

- **Header propagation by `name` only fixed** ([PR #709](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/709))

  Previously `rename` and `default` values were required (even though they were correctly not flagged as required in the json schema).
  The following will now work:
  ```yaml
  headers:
    all:
    - propagate:
        named: test
  ```
- **Fix OTLP hang on reload** ([PR #711](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/711))

  Fixes hang when OTLP exporter is configured and configuration hot reloads.

# [v0.1.0-alpha.10] 2022-03-21

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **Header propagation `remove`'s `name` is now `named`** ([PR #674](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/674))

  This merely renames the `remove` options' `name` setting to be instead `named` to be a bit more intuitively named and consistent with its partner configuration, `propagate`.

  _Previous configuration_

  ```yaml
    # Remove a named header
    - remove:
      name: "Remove" # Was: "name"
  ```
  _New configuration_

  ```yaml
    # Remove a named header
    - remove:
      named: "Remove" # Now: "named"
  ```

- **Command-line flag vs Environment variable precedence changed** ([PR #693](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/693))

  For logging related verbosity overrides, the `RUST_LOG` environment variable no longer takes precedence over the command line argument.  The full order of precedence is now command-line argument overrides environment variable overrides the default setting.

## üöÄ Features

- **Forbid mutations plugin** ([PR #641](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/641))

  The forbid mutations plugin allows you to configure the router so that it disallows mutations.  Assuming none of your `query` requests are mutating data or changing state (they shouldn't!) this plugin can be used to effectively make your graph read-only. This can come in handy when testing the router, for example, if you are mirroring/shadowing traffic when trying to validate a Gateway to Router migration! üò∏

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Add experimental Rhai plugin** ([PR #484](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/484))

  Add an _experimental_ core plugin to be able to extend Apollo Router functionality using [Rhai script](https://rhai.rs/). This allows users to write their own `*_service` function similar to how as you would with a native Rust plugin but without needing to compile a custom router. Rhai scripts have access to the request context and headers directly and can make simple manipulations on them.

  See our [Rhai script documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/rhai) for examples and details!

## üêõ Fixes

- **Correctly set the URL path of the HTTP request in `RouterRequest`** ([Issue #699](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/699))

  Previously, we were not setting the right HTTP path on the `RouterRequest` so when writing a plugin with `router_service` you always had an empty path `/` on `RouterRequest`.

## üìö Documentation

- **We have incorporated a substantial amount of documentation** (via many, many PRs!)

  See our improved documentation [on our website](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/).

# [v0.1.0-alpha.9] 2022-03-16
## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **Header propagation configuration changes** ([PR #599](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/599))

  Header manipulation configuration is now a core-plugin and configured at the _top-level_ of the Router's configuration file, rather than its previous location within service-level layers.  Some keys have also been renamed.  For example:

  **Previous configuration**

  ```yaml
  subgraphs:
    products:
      layers:
        - headers_propagate:
            matching:
              regex: .*
  ```

  **New configuration**

  ```yaml
  headers:
    subgraphs:
      products:
        - propagate:
          matching: ".*"
  ```

- **Move Apollo plugins to top-level configuration** ([PR #623](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/623))

  Previously plugins were all under the `plugins:` section of the YAML config.  However, these "core" plugins are now promoted to the top-level of the config. This reflects the fact that these plugins provide core functionality even though they are implemented as plugins under the hood and further reflects the fact that they receive special treatment in terms of initialization order (they are initialized first before members of `plugins`).

- **Remove configurable layers** ([PR #603](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/603))

  Having `plugins` _and_ `layers` as configurable items in YAML was creating confusion as to when it was appropriate to use a `layer` vs a `plugin`.  As the layer API is a subset of the plugin API, `plugins` has been kept, however the `layer` option has been dropped.

- **Plugin names have dropped the `com.apollographql` prefix** ([PR #602](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/600))

  Previously, core plugins were prefixed with `com.apollographql.`.  This is no longer the case and, when coupled with the above moving of the core plugins to the top-level, the prefixing is no longer present.  This means that, for example, `com.apollographql.telemetry` would now be just `telemetry`.

- **Use `ControlFlow` in checkpoints** ([PR #602](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/602))


- **Add Rhai plugin** ([PR #548](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/484))

  Both `checkpoint` and `async_checkpoint` now `use std::ops::ControlFlow` instead of the `Step` enum.  `ControlFlow` has two variants, `Continue` and `Break`.

- **The `reporting` configuration changes to `telemetry`** ([PR #651](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/651))

  All configuration that was previously under the `reporting` header is now under a `telemetry` key.
## :sparkles: Features

- **Header propagation now supports "all" subgraphs** ([PR #599](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/599))

  It is now possible to configure header propagation rules for *all* subgraphs without needing to explicitly name each subgraph.  You can accomplish this by using the `all` key, under the (now relocated; see above _breaking changes_) `headers` section.

  ```yaml
  headers:
    all:
    - propagate:
      matching: "aaa.*"
    - propagate:
      named: "bbb"
      default: "def"
      rename: "ccc"
    - insert:
      name: "ddd"
      value: "eee"
    - remove:
      matching: "fff.*"
    - remove:
      name: "ggg"
  ```

- **Update to latest query planner from Federation 2** ([PR #653](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/653))

  The Router now uses the `@apollo/query-planner@2.0.0-preview.5` query planner, bringing the most recent version of Federation 2.

## üêõ Fixes

- **`Content-Type` of HTTP responses is now set to `application/json`** ([Issue #639](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/639))

  Previously, we were not setting a `content-type` on HTTP responses.  While plugins can still set a different `content-type` if they'd like, we now ensure that a `content-type` of `application/json` is set when one was not already provided.

- **GraphQL Enums in query parameters** ([Issue #612](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/612))

  Enums in query parameters were handled correctly in the response formatting, but not in query validation.  We now have a new test and a fix.

- **OTel trace propagation works again** ([PR #620](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/620))

  When we re-worked our OTel implementation to be a plugin, the ability to trace across processes (into subgraphs) was lost. This fix restores this capability.  We are working to improve our end-to-end testing of this to prevent further regressions.

- **Reporting plugin schema generation** ([PR #607](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/607))

  Previously our `reporting` plugin configuration was not able to participate in JSON Schema generation. This is now broadly correct and makes writing a syntactically-correct schema much easier.

  To generate a schema, you can still run the same command as before:

  ```
  router --schema > apollo_configuration_schema.json
  ```

  Then, follow the instructions for associating it with your development environment.

- **Input object validation** ([PR #658](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/658))

  Variable validation was incorrectly using output objects instead of input objects

# [v0.1.0-alpha.8] 2022-03-08

## :sparkles: Features

- **Request lifecycle checkpoints** ([PR #558](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/548) and [PR #580](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/548))

    Checkpoints in the request pipeline now allow plugin authors (which includes us!) to check conditions during a request's lifecycle and circumvent further execution if desired.

    Using `Step` return types within the checkpoint it's possible to influence what happens (including changing things like the HTTP status code, etc.).  A caching layer, for example, could return `Step::Return(response)` if a cache "hit" occurred and `Step::Continue(request)` (to allow normal processing to continue) in the event of a cache "miss".

    These can be either synchronous or asynchronous.  To see examples, see:

    - A [synchronous example](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/190afe181bf2c50be1761b522fcbdcc82b81d6ca/examples/forbid-anonymous-operations)
    - An [asynchronous example](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/190afe181bf2c50be1761b522fcbdcc82b81d6ca/examples/async-allow-client-id)

- **Contracts support** ([PR #573](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/573))

  The Apollo Router now supports [Apollo Studio Contracts](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/contracts/)!

- **Add OpenTracing support** ([PR #548](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/548))

  OpenTracing support has been added into the reporting plugin.  You're now able to have span propagation (via headers) via two common formats supported by the `opentracing` crate: `zipkin_b3` and `jaeger`.


## :bug: Fixes

- **Configuration no longer requires `router_url`** ([PR #553](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/553))

  When using Managed Federation or directly providing a Supergraph file, it is no longer necessary to provide a `routing_url` value.  Instead, the values provided by the Supergraph or Studio will be used and the `routing_url` can be used only to override specific URLs for specific subgraphs.

- **Fix plugin ordering** ([PR #559](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/559))

  Plugins need to execute in sequence of declaration *except* for certain "core" plugins (e.g., reporting) which must execute early in the plugin sequence to make sure they are in place as soon as possible in the Router lifecycle. This change now ensures that the reporting plugin executes first and that all other plugins are executed in the order of declaration in configuration.

- **Propagate Router operation lifecycle errors** ([PR #537](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/537))

  Our recent extension rework was missing a key part: Error propagation and handling! This change makes sure errors that occurred during query planning and query execution will be displayed as GraphQL errors instead of an empty payload.


# [v0.1.0-alpha.7] 2022-02-25

## :sparkles: Features

- **Apollo Studio Explorer landing page** ([PR #526](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/526))

  We've replaced the _redirect_ to Apollo Studio with a statically rendered landing page.  This supersedes the previous redirect approach was merely introduced as a short-cut.  The experience now duplicates the user-experience which exists in Apollo Gateway today.

  It is also possible to _save_ the redirect preference and make the behavior sticky for future visits.  As a bonus, this also resolves the failure to preserve the correct HTTP scheme (e.g., `https://`) in the event that the Apollo Router was operating behind a TLS-terminating proxy, since the redirect is now handled client-side.

  Overall, this should be a more durable and more transparent experience for the user.

- **Display Apollo Router version on startup** ([PR #543](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/543))
  The Apollo Router displays its version on startup from now on, which will come in handy when debugging/observing how your application behaves.

## :bug: Fixes

- **Passing a `--supergraph` file supersedes Managed Federation** ([PR #535](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/535))

  The `--supergraph` flag will no longer be silently ignored when the Supergraph is already being provided through [Managed Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/overview) (i.e., when the `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variables are set).  This allows temporarily overriding the Supergraph schema that is fetched from Apollo Studio's Uplink endpoint, while still reporting metrics to Apollo Studio reporting ingress.

- **Anonymous operation names are now empty in tracing** ([PR #525](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/525))

  When GraphQL operation names are not necessary to execute an operation (i.e., when there is only a single operation in a GraphQL document) and the GraphQL operation is _not_ named (i.e., it is anonymous), the `operation_name` attribute on the trace spans that are associated with the request will no longer contain a single hyphen character (`-`) but will instead be an empty string.  This matches the way that these operations are represented during the GraphQL operation's life-cycle as well.

- **Resolved missing documentation in Apollo Explorer** ([PR #540](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/540))

   We've resolved a scenario that prevented Apollo Explorer from displaying documentation by adding support for a new introspection query which also queries for deprecation (i.e., `includeDeprecated`) on `input` arguments.

# [v0.1.0-alpha.6] 2022-02-18

## :sparkles: Features

- **Apollo Studio Managed Federation support** ([PR #498](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/498))

  [Managed Federation]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/overview/

  The Router can now automatically download and check for updates on its schema from Studio (via [Uplink])'s free, [Managed Federation] service.  This is configured in the same way as Apollo Gateway via the `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variables, in the same way as was true in Apollo Gateway ([seen here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/setup/#4-connect-the-gateway-to-studio)). This will also enable operation usage reporting.

  > **Note:** It is not yet possible to configure the Router with [`APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT`].  If you need this behavior, please open a feature request with your use case.

  [`APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT`]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/uplink/#environment-variable

  [operation usage reporting]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/metrics/usage-reporting/#pushing-metrics-from-apollo-server

- **Subgraph header configuration** ([PR #453](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/453))

  The Router now supports passing both client-originated and router-originated headers to specific subgraphs using YAML configuration.  Each subgraph which needs to receive headers can specify which headers (or header patterns) should be forwarded to which subgraph.

  More information can be found in our documentation on [subgraph header configuration].

  At the moment, when using using YAML configuration alone, router-originated headers can only be static strings (e.g., `sent-from-apollo-router: true`).  If you have use cases for deriving headers in the router dynamically, please open or find a feature request issue on the repository which explains the use case.

  [subgraph header configuration]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#configuring-headers-received-by-subgraphs

- **In-flight subgraph `query` de-duplication** ([PR #285](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/285))

  As a performance booster to both the Router and the subgraphs it communicates with, the Router will now _de-duplicate_ multiple _identical_ requests to subgraphs when there are multiple in-flight requests to the same subgraph with the same `query` (**never** `mutation`s), headers, and GraphQL `variables`.  Instead, a single request will be made to the subgraph and the many client requests will be served via that single response.

  There may be a substantial drop in number of requests observed by subgraphs with this release.

- **Operations can now be made via `GET` requests** ([PR #429](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/429))

  The Router now supports `GET` requests for `query` operations.  Previously, the Apollo Router only supported making requests via `POST` requests.  We've always intended on supporting `GET` support, but needed some additional support in place to make sure we could prevent allowing `mutation`s to happen over `GET` requests.

- **Automatic persisted queries (APQ) support** ([PR #433](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/433))

  The Router now handles [automatic persisted queries (APQ)] by default, as was previously the case in Apollo Gateway.  APQ support pairs really well with `GET` requests (which also landed in this release) since they allow read operations (e.g., `GET` requests) to be more easily cached by intermediary proxies and CDNs, which typically forbid caching `POST` requests by specification (even if they often are just reads in GraphQL).  Follow the link above to the documentation to test them out.

  [automatic persisted queries (APQ)]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/

- **New internal Tower architecture and preparation for extensibility** ([PR #319](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/319))

  We've introduced new foundational primitives to the Router's request pipeline which facilitate the creation of composable _onion layers_.  For now, this is largely leveraged through a series of internal refactors and we'll need to document and expand on more of the details that facilitate developers building their own custom extensions.  To leverage existing art &mdash; and hopefully maximize compatibility and facilitate familiarity &mdash; we've leveraged the [Tokio Tower `Service`] pattern.

  This should facilitate a number of interesting extension opportunities and we're excited for what's in-store next.  We intend on improving and iterating on the API's ergonomics for common Graph Router behaviors over time, and we'd encourage you to open issues on the repository with use-cases you might think need consideration.

- **Support for Jaeger HTTP collector in OpenTelemetry** ([PR #479](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/479))

  It is now possible to configure Jaeger HTTP collector endpoints within the `opentelemetry` configuration.  Previously, Router only supported the UDP method.

  The [documentation] has also been updated to demonstrate how this can be configured.

- **Studio agent collector now binds to localhost** [PR #486](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pulls/486)

  The Studio agent collector will bind to `127.0.0.1`.  It can be configured to bind to `0.0.0.0` if desired (e.g., if you're using the collector to collect centrally) by using the [`spaceport.listener` property] in the documentation.

- **Apollo Studio usage reporting agent and operation-level reporting** ([PR #309](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pulls/309), [PR #420](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pulls/420))

  While there are several levels of Apollo Studio integration, the initial phase of our Apollo Studio reporting focuses on operation-level reporting.

  At a high-level, this will allow Apollo Studio to have visibility into some basic schema details, like graph ID and variant, and per-operation details, including:

  - Overall operation latency
  - The number of times the operation is executed
  - [Client awareness] reporting, which leverages the `apollographql-client-*` headers to give visibility into _which clients are making which operations_.

  This should enable several Apollo Studio features including the _Clients_ and _Checks_ pages as well as the _Checks_ tab on the _Operations_ page.

  > *Note:* As a current limitation, the _Fields_ page will not have detailed field-based metrics and on the _Operations_ page the _Errors_ tab, the _Traces_ tab and the _Error Percentage_ graph will not receive data.  We recommend configuring the Router's [OpenTelemetry tracing] with your APM provider and using distributed tracing to increase visibility into individual resolver performance.

  Overall, this marks a notable but still incremental progress toward more of the Studio integrations which are laid out in [#66](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/66).

  Our partner team has improved the handling of Federation 1 supergraphs in the implementation of Federation 2 alpha (which the Router depends on and is meant to offer compatibility with Federation 1 in most cases).  We've updated our query planner implementation to the version with the fixes.

  The Router can now listen on Unix domain sockets (i.e., IPC) in addition to the existing IP-based (port) listening.  This should bring further compatibility with upstream intermediaries who also allow support this form of communication!

  _(Thank you to [@cecton](https://github.com/cecton), both for the PR that landed this feature but also for contributing the upstream PR to `tokio`.)_

## :bug: Fixes

- **Resolved hangs occurring on Router reload when `jaeger` was configured** via [#337](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/337)

  Synchronous calls being made to [`opentelemetry::global::set_tracer_provider`] were causing the runtime to misbehave when the configuration (file) was adjusted (and thus, hot-reloaded) on account of the root context of that call being asynchronous.

  This change adjusts the call to be made from a new thread.  Since this only affected _potential_ runtime configuration changes (again, hot-reloads on a configuration change), the thread spawn is  a reasonable solution.

  [`opentelemetry::global::set_tracer_provider`]: https://docs.rs/opentelemetry/0.10.0/opentelemetry/global/fn.set_tracer_provider.html

## :nail_care: Improvements

> Most of the improvements this time are internal to the code-base but that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about them.  A great developer experience matters both internally and externally! :smile_cat:

- **Store JSON strings in a `bytes::Bytes` instance** via [#284](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/284)

  The router does a a fair bit of deserialization, filtering, aggregation and re-serializing of JSON objects.  Since we currently operate on a dynamic schema, we've been relying on [`serde_json::Value`] to represent this data internally.

  After this change, that `Value` type is now replaced with an equivalent type from a new [`serde_json_bytes`], which acts as an envelope around an underlying `bytes::Bytes`.  This allows us to refer to the buffer that contained the JSON data while avoiding the allocation and copying costs on each string for values that are largely unused by the Router directly.

  This should offer future benefits when implementing &mdash; e.g., query de-duplication and caching &mdash; since a single buffer will be usable by multiple responses at the same time.

  [`serde_json::Value`]: https://docs.rs/serde_json/0.9.8/serde_json/enum.Value.html
  [`serde_json_bytes`]: https://crates.io/crates/serde_json_bytes
  [`bytes::Bytes`]: https://docs.rs/bytes/0.4.12/bytes/struct.Bytes.html

-  **Development workflow improvement** via [#367](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/367)

   Polished away some existing _Problems_ reported by `rust-analyzer` and added troubleshooting instructions to our documentation.

- **Removed unnecessary `Arc` from `PreparedQuery`'s `execute`** via [#328](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/328)

  _...and followed up with [#367](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/367)_

- **Bumped/upstream improvements to `test_span`** via [#359](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/359)

  _...and [`apollographql/test-span#11`](https://github.com/apollographql/test-span/pull/11) upstream_

  Internally, this is just a version bump to the Router, but it required upstream changes to the `test-span` crate.  The bump brings new filtering abilities and adjusts the verbosity of spans tracing levels, and removes non-determinism from tests.

# [v0.1.0-alpha.3] 2022-01-11

## :rocket::waxing_crescent_moon: Public alpha release

> An alpha or beta release is in volatile, active development. The release might not be feature-complete, and breaking API changes are possible between individual versions.

## :sparkles: Features

- Trace sampling [#228](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/228): Tracing each request can be expensive. The router now supports sampling, which allows us to only send a fraction of the received requests.

- Health check [#54](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/54)

## :bug: Fixes

- Schema parse errors [#136](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/136): The router wouldn't display what went wrong when parsing an invalid Schema. It now displays exactly where a the parsing error occured, and why.

- Various tracing and telemetry fixes [#237](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/237): The router wouldn't display what went wrong when parsing an invalid Schema. It now displays exactly where a the parsing error occured, and why.

- Query variables validation [#62](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/62): Now that we have a schema parsing feature, we can validate the variables and their types against the schemas and queries.

## :bug: Fixes

- Handle commas in the @join\_\_graph directive parameters [#101](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/101)

There are several accepted syntaxes to define @join\_\_graph parameters. While we did handle whitespace separated parameters such as `@join__graph(name: "accounts" url: "http://accounts/graphql")`for example, we discarded the url in`@join__graph(name: "accounts", url: "http://accounts/graphql")` (notice the comma). This pr fixes that.

- Invert subgraph URL override logic [#135](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/135)

Subservices endpoint URLs can both be defined in `supergraph.graphql` and in the subgraphs section of the `configuration.yml` file. The configuration now correctly overrides the supergraph endpoint definition when applicable.

- Parse OTLP endpoint address [#156](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/156)

The router OpenTelemetry configuration only supported full URLs (that contain a scheme) while OpenTelemtry collectors support full URLs and endpoints, defaulting to `https`. This pull request fixes that.

## :books: Documentation

A lot of configuration examples and links have been fixed ([#117](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/117), [#120](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/120), [#133](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/133))

## :sparkles: Features

- **Federation 2 alpha**

  The Apollo Router supports the new alpha features of [Apollo Federation 2], including its improved shared ownership model and enhanced type merging.  As new Federation 2 features are released, we will update the Router to bring in that new functionality.

  [Apollo Federation 2]: https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/backend/announcing-federation-2/

- **Supergraph support**

  The Apollo Router supports supergraphs that are published to the Apollo Registry, or those that are composed locally.  Both options are enabled by using [Rover] to produce (`rover supergraph compose`) or fetch (`rover supergraph fetch`) the supergraph to a file.  This file is passed to the Apollo Router using the `--supergraph` flag.

  See the Rover documentation on [supergraphs] for more information!

  [Rover]: https://www.apollographql.com/rover/
  [supergraphs]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/supergraphs/

- **Query planning and execution**

  The Apollo Router supports Federation 2 query planning using the same implementation we use in Apollo Gateway for maximum compatibility.  In the future, we would like to migrate the query planner to Rust.  Query plans are cached in the Apollo Router for improved performance.

- **Performance**

  We've created benchmarks demonstrating the performance advantages of a Rust-based Apollo Router. Early results show a substantial performance improvement over our Node.js based Apollo Gateway, with the possibility of improving performance further for future releases.

  Additionally, we are making benchmarking an integrated part of our CI/CD pipeline to allow us to monitor the changes over time.  We hope to bring awareness of this into the public purview as we have new learnings.

  See our [blog post] for more.

  [blog post]: https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/backend/apollo-router-our-graphql-federation-runtime-in-rust/

- **Apollo Sandbox Explorer**

  [Apollo Sandbox Explorer] is a powerful web-based IDE for creating, running, and managing GraphQL operations.  Visiting your Apollo Router endpoint will take you into the Apollo Sandbox Explorer, preconfigured to operate against your graph.

  [Apollo Sandbox Explorer]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/

- **Introspection support**

  Introspection support makes it possible to immediately explore the graph that's running on your Apollo Router using the Apollo Sandbox Explorer.  Introspection is currently enabled by default on the Apollo Router.  In the future, we'll support toggling this behavior.

- **OpenTelemetry tracing**

  For enabling observability with existing infrastructure and monitoring performance, we've added support using [OpenTelemetry] tracing. A number of configuration options can be seen in the [configuration][configuration 1] documentation under the `opentelemetry` property which allows enabling Jaeger or [OTLP].

  In the event that you'd like to send data to other tracing platforms, the [OpenTelemetry Collector] can be run an agent and can funnel tracing (and eventually, metrics) to a number of destinations which are implemented as [exporters].

  [configuration 1]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#configuration-file
  [OpenTelemetry]: https://opentelemetry.io/
  [OTLP]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md
  [OpenTelemetry Collector]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector
  [exporters]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter

- **CORS customizations**

  For a seamless getting started story, the Apollo Router has CORS support enabled by default with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` set to `*`, allowing access to it from any browser environment.

  This configuration can be adjusted using the [CORS configuration] in the documentation.

  [CORS configuration]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#handling-cors

- **Subgraph routing URL overrides**

  Routing URLs are encoded in the supergraph, so specifying them explicitly isn't always necessary.

  In the event that you have dynamic subgraph URLs, or just want to quickly test something out locally, you can override subgraph URLs in the configuration.

  Changes to the configuration will be hot-reloaded by the running Apollo Router.

## üìö Documentation

  The beginnings of the [Apollo Router's documentation] is now available in the Apollo documentation. We look forward to continually improving it!

- **Quickstart tutorial**

  The [quickstart tutorial] offers a quick way to try out the Apollo Router using a pre-deployed set of subgraphs we have running in the cloud.  No need to spin up local subgraphs!  You can of course run the Apollo Router with your own subgraphs too by providing a supergraph.

- **Configuration options**

  On our [configuration][configuration 2] page we have a set of descriptions for some common configuration options (e.g., supergraph and CORS) as well as a [full configuration] file example of the currently supported options.

# [v0.1.0-prealpha.5] 2021-11-09

## :rocket: Features

- **An updated `CHANGELOG.md`!**

  As we build out the base functionality for the router, we haven't spent much time updating the `CHANGELOG`. We should probably get better at that!

  This release is the last one before reveal! üéâ

## :bug: Fixes

- **Potentially, many!**

  But the lack of clarity goes back to not having kept track of everything thus far! We can _fix_ our processes to keep track of these things! :smile_cat:
