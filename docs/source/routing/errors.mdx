Learn about error codes and HTTP response status codes returned by GraphOS Router and Apollo Router Core.

## HTTP status codes

<PropertyList kind="errCodes">
<Property name="400" short="Bad request">

A request failed GraphQL validation or failed to be parsed.

</Property>
<Property name="401" short="Unauthorized">

Requests may receive this response in two cases:

- For a client request that requires authentication, the client's JWT failed verification.
- For a non-client subscription endpoint calling a subscription callback URL, the router couldn't find a matching subscription identifier between its registered subscriptions and a subscription event.

</Property>
<Property name="405" short="Method not allowed">

<Note>

Both mutations and subscriptions must use POST.

</Note>

</Property>
<Property name="406" short="Not acceptable">

A request's HTTP `Accept` header didn't contain any of the router's supported mime-types:

- `application/json`
- `application/graphql-response+json`
- `multipart/mixed;deferSpec=20220824`
- `multipart/mixed;subscriptionSpec=1.0`.

</Property>

<Property name="429" short="Too many requests">

Request traffic exceeded configured rate limits. See [client side traffic shaping](/router/configuration/traffic-shaping/#client-side-traffic-shaping).

</Property>
<Property name="499" short="Request canceled by client">

The request was canceled because the client closed the connection, possibly due to a client side timeout.

</Property>
<Property name="500" short="Internal server error">

The router encountered an unexpected issue. [Report](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/new?assignees=&labels=raised+by+user&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=) this possible bug to the router team.

</Property>

<Property name="504" short="Request timed out">

The request was not able to complete within a configured amount of time. See [client side traffic shaping timeouts](/router/configuration/traffic-shaping/#timeouts).

</Property>
</PropertyList>

<Note>

You can create Rhai scripts that throw custom status codes. See [Terminating client requests](/graphos/reference/router/rhai#terminating-client-requests) to learn more.

## GraphQL error codes

GraphQL error codes can appear in client responses under `errors[].extensions.code`, which is an established convention found in [GraphQL error extensions](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Errors.Error-result-format). Learn how to see these error codes in Studio via [extended error metrics](/graphos/routing/graphos-reporting#enabling-extended-error-reporting).

<PropertyList kind="errCodes">

<Property name="CANNOT_SEND_PQ_ID_AND_BODY">

The operation was not executed because sending a persisted query ID and a
body in the same request is disallowed.

</Property>
<Property name="CONNECTOR_FETCH">

There was an error fetching data from a connector service.

</Property>
<Property name="COST_ESTIMATED_TOO_EXPENSIVE">

The estimated cost of the query was greater than the configured maximum cost.

</Property>
<Property name="COST_ACTUAL_TOO_EXPENSIVE">

The actual cost of the query was greater than the configured maximum cost.

</Property>
<Property name="COST_QUERY_PARSE_FAILURE">

The query could not be parsed.

</Property>
<Property name="COST_RESPONSE_TYPING_FAILURE">

The response from a subgraph did not match the GraphQL schema.

</Property>
<Property name="GATEWAY_TIMEOUT">

The request timed out when fetching data from a connector service.

</Property>
<Property name="GRAPHQL_VALIDATION_FAILED">

The operation failed during GraphQL validation.

</Property>
<Property name="GRAPHQL_UNKNOWN_OPERATION_NAME">

The operation could not be executed because the operation name was invalid or
did not match an operation in the query document.

</Property>
<Property name="HTTP_CLIENT_ERROR">

There was an error at the HTTP transport layer when fetching data from a
connector service.

</Property>
<Property name="MAX_ALIASES_LIMIT">

The operation was not executed due to exceeding the `max_aliases` limit.

</Property>
<Property name="MAX_DEPTH_LIMIT">

The operation was not executed due to exceeding the `max_depth` limit.

</Property>
<Property name="MAX_HEIGHT_LIMIT">

The operation was not executed due to exceeding the `max_height` limit.

</Property>
<Property name="MAX_ROOT_FIELDS_LIMIT">

The operation was not executed due to exceeding the `max_root_fields` limit.

</Property>
<Property name="QUERY_NOT_IN_SAFELIST">

The operation was not executed because safelisting is enabled and the freeform GraphQL document provided was not found in the persisted query safelist.

</Property>
<Property name="PARSING_ERROR">

The operation could not be parsed as GraphQL.

</Property>
<Property name="PERSISTED_QUERY_HASH_MISMATCH">

The operation was not executed due to a mismatch with the automatic persisted query (APQ) protocol.
There was an attempt to store this operation in the APQ cache, but the provided hash did not match the operation.

</Property>
<Property name="PERSISTED_QUERY_NOT_FOUND">

The operation was not executed because it was not found in the automatic persisted query (APQ) cache.  
This is an expected behavior when using the APQ protocol.

</Property>
<Property name="PERSISTED_QUERY_NOT_SUPPORTED">

An operation attempted to use automatic persisted queries, but the feature was not enabled.

</Property>
<Property name="PERSISTED_QUERY_NOT_IN_LIST">

The operation (specified by ID) was not executed because the ID was not found in the persisted query manifest, and APQs are not enabled.

</Property>
<Property name="PERSISTED_QUERY_ID_REQUIRED">

The router is configured to only execute operations specified by persisted query ID, but the request contained freeform GraphQL instead.

</Property>
<Property name="REQUEST_LIMIT_EXCEEDED">

There was an error due to exceeding the max requests configuration for a
connector service.

</Property>
<Property name="RESPONSE_VALIDATION_FAILED">

The response returned from a subgraph failed validation for the supergraph
schema.

</Property>
<Property name="SUBREQUEST_HTTP_ERROR">

There was an error at the HTTP transport layer when fetching data from a subgraph service.

</Property>
<Property name="UNAUTHORIZED_FIELD_OR_TYPE">

The operation was not fully executed because it attempted to use a field
or type was unauthorized.

</Property>
