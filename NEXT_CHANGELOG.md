# [0.14.1] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## ❗ BREAKING ❗

### Reference-counting for the schema string given to plugins ([PR #???](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/))

The type of the `supergraph_sdl` field of the `apollo_router::plugin::PluginInit` struct
was changed from `String` to `Arc<String>`.
This reduces the number of copies of this string we keep in memory, as schemas can get large.

### Configuration handling enhancements ([PR #1454](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1454))

Router config handling now:
* Allows completely empty configuration without error.
* Prevents unknown tags at the root of the configuration from being silently ignored.
