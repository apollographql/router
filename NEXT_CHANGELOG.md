## üöÄ Features

### Add support for setting multi-value header keys to rhai ([Issue #2211](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2211))

Adds support for setting a header map key with an array. This causes the HeaderMap key/values to be appended() to the map, rather than inserted().

Example use from rhai as:

```
  response.headers["set-cookie"] = [
    "foo=bar; Domain=localhost; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 04 Jan 2023 17:25:27 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None",
    "foo2=bar2; Domain=localhost; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 04 Jan 2023 17:25:27 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None",
  ];
```

## üêõ Fixes

### Filter nullified deferred responses ([Issue #2213](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2168))

[`@defer` spec updates](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/compare/01d7b98f04810c9a9db4c0e53d3c4d54dbf10b82...f58632f496577642221c69809c32dd46b5398bd7#diff-0f02d73330245629f776bb875e5ca2b30978a716732abca136afdd028d5cd33cR448-R470)
mandate that a deferred response should not be sent if its path points to an element of the response that was nullified
in a previous payload.

### wait for opentelemetry tracer provider to shutdown ([PR #2191](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2191))

When we drop Telemetry we spawn a thread to perform the global opentelemetry trace provider shutdown. The documentation of this function indicates that "This will invoke the shutdown method on all span processors. span processors should export remaining spans before return". We should give that process some time to complete (5 seconds currently) before returning from the `drop`. This will provide more opportunity for spans to be exported.

## üõ† Maintenance

### improve plugin registration predictability ([PR #2181](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2181))

This replaces [ctor](https://crates.io/crates/ctor) with [linkme](https://crates.io/crates/linkme). `ctor` enables rust code to execute before `main`. This can be a source of undefined behaviour and we don't need our code to execute before `main`. `linkme` provides a registration mechanism that is perfect for this use case, so switching to use it makes the router more predictable, simpler to reason about and with a sound basis for future plugin enhancements.

### it_rate_limit_subgraph_requests fixed ([Issue #2213](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2213))

This test was failing frequently due to it being a timing test being run in a single threaded tokio runtime.

### Update to Rust 1.65 ([Issue #2220](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2220))

Rust MSRV incremented to 1.65.
