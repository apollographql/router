title: Customizations for the Apollo Router
description: Extend your router with custom functionality
---

You can create **customizations** for the Apollo Router to add functionality that isn't available via built-in [configuration options](../configuration/overview/). For example, you can make an external call to fetch authentication data for each incoming request.

## Customization types

The Apollo Router supports the following customization types:

- [**Rhai scripts**](./rhai/)
    - The [Rhai scripting language](https://rhai.rs/book/) enables you to add functionality directly to your stock router binary by hooking into different phases of the router's request lifecycle.
- [**External co-processing**](./coprocessor/) ([Enterprise feature](../enterprise-features/))
    - If your organization has a [GraphOS Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/), you can write custom request-handling code in any language. This code can run in the same container as your router or separately.
    - The router calls your custom code via HTTP, passing it the details of each incoming client request.

**Use [Rhai scripts](./rhai/) if they support your use case.** External co-processing is most helpful if your customization needs to do any of the following (which Rhai scripts _don't_ support):

- Read or write to disk
- Make network requests
- Use libraries from a particular language or framework

Next, see the documentation for your preferred [customization type](#customization-types).
