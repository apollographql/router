## ❗ BREAKING ❗

### Plugin utilities cleanup ([PR #819](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/819)) ([PR #908](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/908))
Utilities around creating Request and Response structures have been migrated to builders.

Migration:
* `plugin_utils::RouterRequest::builder()`->`RouterRequest::fake_builder()`
* `plugin_utils::RouterResponse::builder()`->`RouterResponse::fake_builder()`

In addition, the `plugin_utils` module has been removed. Mock service functionality has been migrated to `plugin::utils::test`.
### Plugin API changes [PR #855](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/855)
Previously the Plugin trait has three lifecycle hooks: new, startup, and shutdown.

Startup and shutdown are problematic because:
* Plugin construction happens in new and startup. This means creating in new and populating in startup.
* Startup and shutdown has to be explained to the user.
* Startup and shutdown ordering is delicate.

The lifecycle now looks like this:
1. `new`
2. `activate`
3. `drop`

Users can migrate their plugins using the following:
* `Plugin#startup`->`Plugin#new`
* `Plugin#shutdown`->`Drop#drop`

In addition, the `activate` lifecycle hook is now not marked as deprecated, and users are free to use it.

## 🚀 Features

###  Configurable client identification headers [PR #850](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/850)
The router uses the HTTP headers `apollographql-client-name` and `apollographql-client-version` to identify clients in Studio telemetry. Those headers can now be overriden in the configuration:
```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  apollo:
    # Header identifying the client name. defaults to apollographql-client-name
    client_name_header: <custom_client_header_name>
    # Header identifying the client version. defaults to apollographql-client-version
    client_version_header: <custom_version_header_name>
```

## 🐛 Fixes
###  Configuration errors on hot-reload are output [PR #850](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/850)
If a configuration file had errors on reload these were silently swallowed. These are now added to the logs.

## 🛠 Maintenance
### End to end integration tests for Jaeger [PR #850](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/850)
Jaeger tracing end to end test including client->router->subgraphs

### Router tracing span cleanup [PR #850](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/850)
Spans generated by the Router are now aligned with plugin services.

### Simplified CI for windows [PR #850](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/850)
All windows processes are spawned via xtask rather than a separate CircleCI stage.

### Enable default feature in graphql_client [PR #905](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/905)
removing the default feature can cause build issues in plugins.

## 📚 Documentation
### Enhanced rust docs ([PR #819](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/819))
Many more rust docs have been added.
