As your graph grows, you may need to debug a problematic query for one reason or another. The GraphOS Router and `@apollo/gateway` both serve as an entry point into your federated graph and offer ways to debug requests.

Each client request goes through a process called [query planning](/graphos/explorer/additional-features/#query-plans-for-supergraphs) that generates the subgraph requests to execute. You can log out the query plan in both the router and gateway.

## Output query plans with headers

With router v0.16.0+ and `@apollo/gateway` v2.5.4+, you can pass the following headers to return the query plans in the GraphQL response extensions:

- Including the `Apollo-Query-Plan-Experimental` header returns the query plan in the response extensions
- Additionally, including the `Apollo-Query-Plan-Experimental-Format` header with one of the supported options changes the output format:
  - A value of `prettified` returns a human-readable string of the query plan
  - A value of `internal` returns a JSON representation of the query plan

## Log router subgraph calls

If, instead, you want to debug your subgraph HTTP requests in a router instance, you can use [Rhai scripts](/router/customizations/rhai) to log the necessary information out. An example Rhai script is shown below.

<Caution>

While it's possible to log out the variables, Apollo strongly recommends not
doing so to avoid leaking sensitive information into your logs.

</Caution>

```rhai
fn subgraph_service(service, subgraph) {
  service.map_request(|request| {
      log_info(`Subgraph: ${subgraph} Query: ${request.subgraph.body.query}`);
  });
}
```

The above uses an inline closure within the `map_request` function of the `subgraph_service` hook to log the subgraph-related information.

To enable query plans, you must run the router with the `--dev` flag and leverage [Apollo Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox) to [display your query plans](/graphos/explorer/additional-features/#query-plans-for-supergraphs).

As an alternative to using `--dev`, you can also enable query plans via the below configuration option, however, Apollo strongly discourages this as the feature may be removed or renamed in the future.

```yaml
plugins:
  experimental.expose_query_plan: true
```

## Log `@apollo/gateway` subgraph calls

To debug queries to your subgraphs within an `@apollo/gateway` instance, you can use a [`buildService` function](/apollo-server/using-federation/api/apollo-gateway/#configuring-the-subgraph-fetcher) to log the operation name and body.

<Caution>

While it's possible to log out the variables, Apollo strongly recommends not
doing so to avoid leaking sensitive information into your logs.

</Caution>

```ts
class DebugDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
  willSendRequest({
    request
  }: GraphQLDataSourceProcessOptions<
    Record<string, any>
  >): void | Promise<void> {
    console.log(`Operation name: ${request.operationName}`);
    console.log(`Query body: ${request.query}`);
  }
}
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  debug: true,
  supergraphSdl,
  buildService({url}) {
    return new DebugDataSource({url});
  }
});
```

The above snippet creates a new class called `DebugDataSource` to log out the operation name and body using the `willSendRequest` hook, which is called before execution.

Lastly, it also enables the `debug` setting on the gateway configuration to print out query plans in the logs for further debugging if needed.
