title: Migrating to the Apollo Router from @apollo/gateway
---

The Apollo Router is a graph router for federated graphs that's written in the Rust programming language. It's a new, higher-performance alternative to the Node.js-based `@apollo/gateway` library.

If you're currently using the `@apollo/gateway` library in your federated graph, this article walks you through the steps to move over to the Apollo Router.

## What's different?

Unlike `@apollo/gateway`, the Apollo Router is usually packaged as a _static, standalone binary_. You can pass this binary a YAML configuration file at startup to customize its behavior, and you can even _modify_ that configuration and pick up changes without restarting the router.

You _can_ use the Apollo Router as a library in a larger project, but our goal is to remove the need to write custom code in your graph router (as is necessary with `@apollo/gateway`). Instead, the Apollo Router exposes the most common critical features via declarative configuration.

## Take inventory of your gateway configuration

The `@apollo/gateway` library is an extension to the Apollo Server library, and you need to consider your existing configuration of _both_ libraries when moving to the Apollo Router. For example, you might be customizing which HTTP headers your subgraphs receive from client requests, or passing specific headers _back_ to the client from specific subgraphs.

Because the Apollo Router is an entirely new tool with a different configuration mechanism, you should make a checklist of your gateway's custom behaviors to make sure those behaviors all remain when your migration is complete.

Start by looking for configuration and customizations in these places:

- Environment variables
- Non-Apollo telemetry and instrumentation (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Datadog)
- Constructor options passed to `new ApolloGateway({ ... })`
- Constructor options passed to `new ApolloServer({ ... })`
- Specific `plugins` passed to `new ApolloServer({ plugins: [ ... ] })`
- Custom middleware (e.g., Express, Koa, Fastify)

The sections below provide more details on what to look for in each of these categories.

## Environment variables

Many Apollo tools use environment variables prefixed with `APOLLO_` to set certain values, such as an API key for communicating with Apollo Studio.

Make sure to note any environment variables you set in your existing gateway's environment, _especially_ those prefixed with `APOLLO_`

The Apollo Router supports most (non-deprecated) `APOLLO_`-prefixed environment variables, including:

- `APOLLO_KEY`
- `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`

> Deprecated Apollo environment variables (such as `ENGINE_API_KEY`) are _not_ supported.
>
> Additionally, the Apollo Router does not currently support the [`APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/uplink/#environment-variable) variable.  If you require this functionality, please follow and vote on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/692).

## `ApolloGateway` constructor options

The number of options you currently provide to your `ApolloGateway` constructor varies depending on whether you're using [managed federation](./managed-federation/overview/). If you _are_ using managed federation, you might even be providing _zero_ options to this constructor!

### `supergraphSdl`

This constructor option is used in _non_-managed federation to provide a composed supergraph schema via a file or other string. Usually, that schema is composed using the [Rover CLI](/rover/supergraphs/).

You can achieve this option's effect with the Apollo Router in one of the following ways:

* [Move to managed federation](./managed-federation/setup/) with your move to the Apollo Router.
* Provide the `--supergraph` command-line argument to the Apollo Router on startup:

    ```
    ./router --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
    ```

    The router watches this file and hot-reloads its supergraph schema whenever it changes.

### `serviceList` / `IntrospectAndCompose`

If you provide one of these constructor options, your gateway performs its _own_ supergraph schema composition on startup. **The Apollo Router does not support this in-process composition.**

Instead, you need to perform composition using [managed federation](./managed-federation/setup/) or the [Rover CLI](/rover/supergraphs/). With either of these methods, the Apollo Router can hot-reload its supergraph schema without restarting, and you avoid the possibility of a composition failure that results in downtime.

### `buildService`

The buildService function enables us to customize the requests that are sent to your subgraphs.

This is often used to:
* Override subgraph URLs at runtime - Now you can use [`override_subgraph_urls`](./configuration/overview#overriding_subgraph_routing_urls).
* Propagate headers to subgraphs via `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` - Now you can use [`headers`](./configuration/header-propagation).

### `logger`

This constructor option enables you to specify a different logger for messages that were produced by the `ApolloGateway`. By default, it inherits from the `logger` on your `ApolloServer` instance.  This option is also useful for changing logging verbosity.

In the Apollo Router, logging is JSON-structured in production environments by default, and the verbosity can be adjusted. More advanced logging can be enabled through the use of [plugins](#plugins).

For more information, see [Logging](./configuration/logging/).

## `ApolloServer` constructor options

The `ApolloServer` constructor supports a large variety of options, but for the purposes of migrating to the Apollo Router, we'll focus on the following:

- `context`
- `plugins`

> For the full list of options, see [`ApolloServer` options](/apollo-server/api/apollo-server#options). If you're using other options, additional migration steps might be necessary to replicate the same behavior. Please open a discussion on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router) so we can understand your needs and help you with a solution.

### `context`

The `context` parameter is an object that is which allows you to propagate information across the request lifecycle. Use cases include:
* Authentication information.
* Header propagation.

The Apollo Router has [similar functionality](./customizations/native#context).

### `plugins`

It was often necessary to write various plugins for Apollo Server, which is the foundation that Apollo Gateway runs on.  These plugins are passed to the `new ApolloServer({ ... })` constructor options in the `plugins` array.  First, take note of each plugin and its use-cases and add it to your check-list, then consider approaches to accomplish the same thing in the Apollo Router.  Plugins might not map one-to-one to plugins in the Apollo Router, but you'll find similar techniques.

Generally speaking, Apollo Router is trying to minimize the number of cases where custom plugins are necessary to perform common behaviors. For example, setting custom HTTP status codes, transmitting telemetry data, etc.  To facilitate this, Apollo Router has a YAML-structured configuration that enables common behaviors:

- Propagating particular/all headers to subgraphs
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation and distributed tracing support
- Adjusting logging verbosity

Prior to re-implementing existing Apollo Gateway plugin behavior in a new language (Rust), we encourage our community to start (or engage on existing) conversations about desired customizations in the [GitHub Discussions on the Router repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/).  There are various core plugins we think the Apollo Router could offer out of the box and we'd like help to discuss their design.

For less common use-cases, we also want to help build an ecosystem of plugins that can exist for Apollo Router, allowing users to enable more custom behaviors and to be able to ship the functionality they need before native support is available.

Apollo Router enables a variety of customizations to built through its request-pipeline plugins.  Today all of its plugins are written in Rust.  In the future, we expect to offer the ability to enable functionality in other languages, in the supergraph itself, or by communicating with services alongside the Router (e.g., gRPC, etc).

To facilitate writing Rust plugins, we've put together a series of examples of common plugins and those can be found in the [Customizations](./customizations/overview) documentation.   There we talk about the integration-points of the request-pipeline which can be customized, the types of plugins which can be written, and also offer examples of how they can be used.

If you don't find the migration answers you need in our documentation, we'd love to know.  Please search for existing [Discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/) and start a new discussion if you don't find what you're looking for.
