### Unified supergraph and execution response types

`apollo_router::services::supergraph::Response` and 
`apollo_router::services::execution::Response` were two structs with identical fields
and almost-identical methods.
The main difference was that builders were fallible for the former but not the latter.

They are now the same type (with one location a `type` alias of the other), with fallible builders.
Callers may need to add either a operator `?` (in plugins) or an `.unwrap()` call (in tests).

```diff
 let response = execution::Response::builder()
     .error(error)
     .status_code(StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST)
     .context(req.context)
-    .build();
+    .build()?;
```
