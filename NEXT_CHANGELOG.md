# [0.12.1] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## ❗ BREAKING ❗

### Remove the generic stream type from RouterResponse and ExecutionResponse ([PR #1420](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1420)

This generic type complicates the API with limited benefit because we use BoxStream everywhere in plugins:
* `RouterResponse<BoxStream<'static, Response>>` -> `RouterResponse`
* `ExecutionResponse<BoxStream<'static, Response>>` -> `ExecutionResponse`

## 🚀 Features

### Experimental support for the `@defer` directive ([PR #1182](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1182)

The router can now understand the `@defer` directive, used to tag parts of a query so the response is split into
multiple parts that are sent one by one.

:warning: *this is still experimental and not fit for production use yet*

To activate it, add this option to the configuration file:

```yaml
server:
  experimental_defer_support: true
```

### Rewrite the caching API ([PR #1281](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1281)

This introduces a new asynchronous caching API that opens the way to multi level caching (in memory and
database). The API revolves around an `Entry` structure that allows query deduplication and lets the
client decide how to generate the value to cache, instead of a complicated delegate system inside the
cache.

## 🐛 Fixes

### **A Rhai error instead of a Rust panic** ([PR #1414 https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1414)

In Rhai plugins, accessors that mutate the originating request are not available when in the subgraph phase. Previously trying to mutate anyway would cause a Rust panic. This has been changed to a Rhai error instead.
