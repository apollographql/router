import { Link } from "gatsby";

The Apollo Router supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), with exporters for:

* [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)
* [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/)
* [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
* [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md) over HTTP or gRPC

The Apollo Router generates spans that include the various phases of serving a request and associated dependencies. This is useful for showing how response time is affected by:

* Sub-request response times
* Query shape (sub-request dependencies)
* Apollo Router post-processing

Span data is sent to a collector such as [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), which can assemble spans into a gantt chart for analysis.

> To get the most out of distributed tracing, _all_ components in your system should be instrumented.

## Common configuration

### Trace config

In your router's YAML config file, the `trace_config` section contains common configuration that's used by all exporters. This section is optional, and it falls back on the values of environment variables specified by the [OpenTelemetry spec](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/sdk-environment-variables.md) if `service_name` is not set.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    trace_config:
      service_name: "router"
      service_namespace: "apollo"
      # Optional. Either a float between 0 and 1 or 'always_on' or 'always_off'
      sampler: 0.1

      # Optional. Use a parent based sampler. This enables remote spans help make a decision on if a span is sampeld or not.
      # https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/sdk.md#parentbased
      parent_based_sampler: false

      # Optional limits
      max_attributes_per_event: 10
      max_attributes_per_link: 10
      max_attributes_per_span: 10
      max_events_per_span: 10
      max_links_per_span: 10

      # Attributes particular to an exporter that have not
      # been explicitly handled in Router configuration.
      attributes:
        some.config.attribute: "config value"
```

If `service_name` is set, then environment variables are not used. However, you can embed environment variables into your router config using Unix `${key:default}` syntax.

If no environment variable is set and `service_name` is not present then `router` is used as the default service name.

### Propagation

The `propagation` section allows you to configure which propagators are active in addition to those automatically activated by using an exporter.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    propagation:
      # https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/
      baggage: false

      # https://www.datadoghq.com/
      datadog: false

      # https://www.jaegertracing.io/ (compliant with opentracing)
      jaeger: false

      # https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/
      trace_context: false

      # https://zipkin.io/ (compliant with opentracing)
      zipkin: false

```
Specifying explicit propagation is generally only required if you're using an exporter that supports multiple trace ID formats (e.g., OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, or OpenTracing compatible exporters).

## Using Datadog

The Apollo Router can be configured to connect to either the default agent address or a URL.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    datadog:
      # Either 'default' or a URL
      endpoint: default
```

## Using Jaeger

The Apollo Router can be configured to export tracing data to Jaeger either via an agent or http collector.

### Agent config

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    jaeger:
      agent:
        # Either 'default' or a URL
        endpoint: docker_jaeger:14268

```

### Collector config

If you're using Kubernetes, you can inject your secrets into configuration via environment variables:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    jaeger:
      collector:
        endpoint: "http://my-jaeger-collector"
        username: "${JAEGER_USERNAME}"
        password: "${JAEGER_PASSWORD}"
```

## OpenTelemetry Collector via OTLP

[OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) is a horizontally scalable collector that you can use to receive, process, and export your telemetry data in a pluggable way.

If you find that the built-in telemetry features of the Apollo Router are missing some desired functionality (e.g., [exporting to Kafka](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#exporters)), then it's worth considering this option.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    otlp:
      # Either 'default' or a URL
      endpoint: default

      # Optional protocol (Defaults to grpc)
      protocol: grpc

      # Optional Grpc configuration
      grpc:
        domain_name: "my.domain"
        key:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        ca:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        cert:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        metadata:
          foo: bar

      # Optional Http configuration
      http:
        headers:
          foo: bar

      # Optional timeout in humatime form
      timeout: 2s

```


## Using Zipkin

The Apollo Router can be configured to export tracing data to either the default collector address or a URL:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    zipkin:
      # Either 'default' or a URL
      endpoint: http://my_zipkin_collector.dev
```
