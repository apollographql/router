title: Logging common configuration
---

The Apollo Router provides built-in support for logging to stdout and files.

## Common configuration

Logging common configuration allow you to set:
* Service name
* Resource attributes

### Service name

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  logging:
    common:
      # (Optional) Set the service name to easily find metrics related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
      service_name: "router"
```

Service name discovery is handled in the following order:
1. `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` env
2. `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` env
3. `router.yaml` `service_name`
4. `router.yaml` `resource`

If none of the above are found then the service name will be set to `unknown_service:apollo_router` or `unknown_service` if the executable name cannot be determined.

### Resource

A Resource is a set of key-value pairs that provide additional context to logs, for instance as fields. APMs may interpret and display resource information. 

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  logging:
    common:
      resource:
        "environment.name": "production"
        "environment.namespace": "{env.MY_K8_NAMESPACE_ENV_VARIABLE}"
```
