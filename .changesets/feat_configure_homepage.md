### Apollo Router landing page ([PR #2282](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2282))

We've added a `graph_ref` option to the `homepage` configuration, this will allow you to redirect from the Apollo Router landing page back to Apollo Studio Explorer.  The experience now duplicates the user-experience which exists in Apollo Gateway today.
