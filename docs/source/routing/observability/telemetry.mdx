Since the router is the single access point for all traffic to and from your graph, router telemetry is the most comprehensive way to observe your supergraph. By implementing telemetry, you can:

- Monitor your supergraph's health and performance
- Diagnose issues and deduce root causes
- Optimize resource usage and system reliability

## How router telemetry works

By default, the router doesn't collect and export any telemetry beyond [what it sends to GraphOS](). You configure which telemetry data to collect and where to export it via your router's configuration file.

The router request lifecycle is the primary data source for telemetry data or _signals_. These signals include _logs_, _metrics_, and _traces_. The section on [router telemetry signals](#) details these data types and gives basic configuration examples.

_Exporters_ are responsible for sending telemetry data to your application performance monitoring (APM) and observability tools for storage, visualization, and analysis.

    lifecycle-->exporters
    end

    apms["APM, agent,<br/>or collector"]
    exporters-->apms

```

### Telemetry exporters

The router emits telemetry in the industry-standard OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) format and is therefore compatible with many APM tools, including:

- Prometheus
- OpenTelemetry Collector
- Datadog
- New Relic
- Jaeger
- Zipkin

### Attributes and selectors

Attributes and selectors are key-value pairs that add contextual information about the router request lifecycle to telemetry data. You can annotate events, metrics, and spans with them and then use them to filter and group data in your APMs.

The router supports a set of standard attributes from [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/). Example attributes include:

- HTTP status code  
- GraphQL operation name  
- Subgraph name

Selectors allow you define custom data points based on the router's request lifecycle. 

|  | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Attribute** | Standard data points that can be attached to spans, instruments, and events. |
| **Selector** | Custom data points extracted from the router's request lifecycle, tailored to specific needs. |

This configuration snippet enables including a subgraph's name in whatever telemetry data is being collected.

### Conditions

You can set conditions for instruments and events to only collect telemetry data [when necessary](#collect-exactly-the-telemetry-you-need). This configuration snippet enables only collecting the relevant telemetry data when 

\<condition-example\>.

\<example config\>

## Router telemetry signals

The router supports three signal types for collecting and exporting telemetry:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Signal</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/graphos/routing/observability/telemetry#logs-and-events">Logs and events</a></td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Capture and export logs in text or JSON format.</li>
          <li>Trigger custom events to log critical actions during the router request lifecycle.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/graphos/routing/observability/telemetry#metrics-and-instruments">Metrics and instruments</a></td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Export standard metrics for Router operations.</li>
          <li>Leverage OpenTelemetry (OTEL) metrics to capture HTTP lifecycle data.</li>
          <li>Define custom metrics using attributes and selectors.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/graphos/routing/observability/telemetry#traces-and-spans">Traces and spans</a></td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Export traces of router transactions.</li>
          <li>Use spans to monitor specific actions within traces and attach attributes or selectors for deeper insights.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


These mechanisms let you collect data about the inner workings of your router and graph and export them accordingly. 

### Logs and events

Logs record events in the router's request lifecycle. Examples of logged events include:

- Information about the router lifecycle  
- Warnings about misconfiguration  
- Errors that occurred during a request

#### Log exporters

You can log events to standard output in either text or JSON format. Logs can also be consumed by [logging exporters](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/logging/overview) and as part of [spans](/graphos/routing/observability/telemetry#traces-and-spans) via [tracing exporters](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/tracing/overview).

### Metrics and instruments

Metrics are measurements of the router's behavior, for example, the number of incoming HTTP requests. Metrics are numeric values that are collected and often analyzed over time to identify trends.

Instruments define _how_ to collect and report metrics. Different kinds of instruments include counters, gauges, and histograms. Given the metric “number of incoming HTTP requests”, different instruments collect a count, histogram, and gauge of this metric.

#### Instrument types

Metric instruments fall into three categories:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Instrument Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Router instruments</strong></td>
      <td>
        Standard instruments for the router's request life cycle, including:
        <ul>
          <li>The number of HTTP requests by HTTP status</li>
          <li>A histogram of HTTP router request duration</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>OTEL instruments</strong></td>
      <td>
        Standard OpenTelemetry instruments around the HTTP lifecycle, including:
        <ul>
          <li>The number of active requests in flight</li>
          <li>A histogram of request body sizes</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Custom instrument</strong></td>
      <td>
        Custom instruments defined in the router's request life cycle.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Example instrument configuration

This configuration snippet enables OTEL instrumentation for a histogram of request body sizes:

\<example config\>

See [Instruments](/router/configuration/telemetry/instrumentation/instruments) for an overview of available instruments and a guide for configuring and customizing instruments.

#### Metric exporters

Metrics can be consumed and monitored by exporters. 

\<Mermaid diagram of below\>  

This configuration snippet enables exporting metrics to a Datadog agent:

\<example config\>

See [Metrics exporters](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/metrics/overview) for an overview of supported exporters.

#### Dropping metrics using views

Define views to filter out specific metrics before export, ensuring only relevant data is captured.

### Traces and spans

Traces monitor the flow of a request through the router. A trace is composed of [spans](/router/configuration/telemetry/instrumentation/spans). A span captures a request's duration as it flows through the router request lifecycle. Spans may include contextual information about the request, such as the HTTP status code or the name of the subgraph being queried.

Examples of spans include:

- router \- Wraps an entire request from the HTTP perspective  
- supergraph \- Wraps a request once GraphQL parsing has taken place  
- subgraph \- Wraps a request to a subgraph.

#### Tracing exporters

Traces are consumed via [tracing exporters](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/tracing/overview).

## Best practices

### Collect exactly the telemetry you need

Effective telemetry provides just the right amount and granularity of information to maintain your graph. Too much data can overwhelm your system, for example, with high cardinality metrics. Too little may not provide enough information to debug issues.

Specific events that need to be captured—and the conditions under which they need to be captured—can change as client applications and graphs change. Different environments, such as production and development, can have different observability requirements.

Router telemetry is customizable to meet the observability needs of different graphs. Keep in mind your particular environments’ and graphs’ requirements when configuring your telemetry.
