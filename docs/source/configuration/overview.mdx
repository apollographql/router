import { Link } from "gatsby";

TODO:

Probably have a section that talks about the various ways to configure the RouteR:

- CLI arguments
- Configuration file
- Supergraph schema

---


> For installation instructions, see the [quickstart](../quickstart/).

You run Apollo Router with the following command (assuming you're in the same directory as the `router` executable):

```bash
./router --config configuration.yaml --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
```

Options are described below.

## Options

<td>

##### `-s` / `--supergraph`

</td>
<td>

The absolute or relative path to the router's [supergraph schema](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/#federated-schemas).

To learn how to compose your supergraph schema with the Rover CLI, see the [Federation quickstart](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/quickstart/#3-compose-the-supergraph-schema).

**Required** unless you provide this value via the `SCHEMA_PATH` environment variable.

## Configuration-awareness in your text editor

The Apollo Router is able to produce a JSON schema for use in your text editor. It significantly eases the burden of making
sure that your yaml file is correctly formatted, and even gives you content assist.

To generate the schema use:
```bash
router --schema > configuration_schema.json
```

One you have generated the schema configure your text editor. Here are some instructions for well known editors:
* [Emacs](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-yaml)
* [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/json.html#ws_json_using_schemas)
* [Sublime](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-yaml)
* [Vim](https://github.com/Quramy/vison)
* [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings)

## Configuration file

Apollo Router takes an optional YAML configuration file as input via the `--config` option. All supported configuration options are shown below:

```yaml title="configuration.yaml"
#
# The Apollo Router doesn't require a configuration file to run. This
# example is a verbose representation of possible configuration. It's
# more of an "everything and the kitchen sink" of potential configuration
# rather than any recommendation.
#

#
# server: Configuration of the HTTP server
#
server:
  # The socket address and port to listen on
  # Defaults to 127.0.0.1:4000
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000

  #
  # CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
  #
  cors:
    # Set to false to disallow any origin and rely exclusively on `origins`
    # Defaults to true
    allow_any_origin: true
    # List of accepted origins
    origins:
      - https://studio.apollographql.com
    # Set to true to add the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header
    allow_credentials: false
    # The headers to allow.
    # Defaults to the required request header for Apollo Studio: Content-Type
    allow_headers: [ Content-Type ]
    # Allowed request methods
    # Defaults to GET, POST, OPTIONS.
    methods: [ GET, POST, OPTIONS ]
    # Which response headers should be made available to scripts running in the
    # browser in response to a cross-origin request.
    expose_headers:
plugins:
    # See below for plugins
```
## Passing headers to subgraphs

You can customize which HTTP headers the Apollo Router includes in its requests to your individual subgraphs. You specify these headers on a per-subgraph basis in your [YAML configuration file](#configuration-file).

More specifically, each the headers plugin include can be configured with an array of header-related actions for the router to perform (in order) before sending a request:

```yaml{4-12}
plugins:
  # ...other configuration...

  apollo.headers:
    all:
    - propagate:
        matching:
          regex: ^upstream-header-.*
    - remove:
        name: "x-legacy-account-id"
    subgraphs:
      products:
        - insert:
            name: "router-subgraph-name"
            value: "products"

```

The following transformations are specific to customizing headers sent to subgraphs:

### `propagate`

Enables you to selectively propagate headers that were included in the client's request to the router.

> **Note:** The Router _never_ propagates so-called [hop-by-hop headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#hop-by-hop_headers), such as `Content-Length`.

You can specify which headers to propagate based on a matching [regex pattern](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/):

```yaml
- propagate:
    matching:
      regex: .*
```

You can also provide a static string with the `named` option. These `named` configurations have additional flexibility, because they support the following options:

- `default_value`: A value to set if _no_ value was sent by the client
- `rename`: Renames the header's key to the provided value

```yaml
- propagate:
      named: "x-user-id"
      value: "abc123"
      rename: "account-id"
```

### `remove`

Enables you to selectively remove headers that were included in the client's request to the router. Similar to [`headers_propagate`](#headers-propagate), this option can match either a static string or a [regular expression](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/).

> **Note:** The Router _never_ propagates so-called [hop-by-hop headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#hop-by-hop_headers), such as `Content-Length`.

```yaml
# Do not send this subgraph the "Cookie" header.
- remove:
    named: "Cookie"
- remove:
    matching:
      # Remove headers that include the legacy 'x-' prefix.
      regex: ^x-.*$
```

### `headers_insert`

Enables you to add custom headers to requests going to a specific subgraph. These headers are always static strings that originate in the router, instead of originating in the client.

```yaml
- insert:
    name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router"
    value: "indeed"
```

### Example

Here's an example of customizing different headers for two subgraphs: `accounts` and `products`. These two subgraphs are both sent `router-subgraph-name` headers with either the `accounts` or `products` value, respectively. Any other subgraph receives _no_ headers.

```yaml
plugins:
  apollo.headers:
    all:
    # All subgraphs will propagate matching headers.
    - propagate:
        matching:
          regex: ^upstream-header-.*
    # All subgraphs will propagate matching headers.
    - propagate:
        named: "some-header"
        default: "default-value"
        rename: "destination-header"
    # All subgraphs will remove the "x-legacy-account-id" header.
    - remove:
        named: "x-legacy-account-id"
    - remove:
        matching: "x-legacy-account-id"
    # Subgraph specific configuration
    subgraphs:
      products:
        # Calls to the products subgraph will have the "router-subgraph-name" header.
        - insert:
            name: "router-subgraph-name"
            value: "products"
```

## Avoiding repetition using YAML anchors and aliases

You can avoid repeating sections of configuration multiple times in your configuration file using standard YAML anchors and aliasing techniques:

```yaml {5,9} title="configuration.yaml"
plugins:
  apollo.headers:
    subgraphs:
      products:
        - insert: &insert_custom_header
            name: "custom-header"
            value: "something"
      reviews:
        - insert: *insert_custom_header
```

In this example, the `&insert_custom_header` anchor captures the `name` and `value` properties from the `products` subgraph's `insert` and re-uses the same properties in the `insert` of the `reviews` subgraph by referring to the `*insert_custom_header` alias.

## OpenTelemetry tracing

The Apollo Router supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), with exporters for [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) and the [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/components/otlp-exporter) over HTTP or gRPC. The router generates traces that include the various phases of executing a GraphQL operation and associated dependencies.

The router sends a `TraceParent` header to subgraphs so they can create and send their own spans under the same trace.

If the router receives an incoming request that already contains a `TraceParent` header, it uses that header's trace ID instead of generating a random one.

### Using Jaeger

```yaml title="configuration.yaml"
server:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
plugins:
  apollo.reporting:
    # Optional if you want to enable opentracing propagation headers to your subgraphs
    # opentracing:
      # "zipkin_b3" and "jaeger" formats are supported
      # format: "zipkin_b3"
    opentelemetry:
      jaeger:
        # optional: if not present, jaeger will use the default UDP agent address
        #endpoint:
          # address for the UDP agent mode
          # incomptable with collector
          # agent: "127.0.0.1:1234"

          # URL of the HTTP collector
          # collector:" http://example.org"
          # the username and password are obtained from the environment variables
          # JAEGER_USERNAME and JAEGER_PASSWORD

        # name of the service used in traces
        # defaults to router
        service_name: "router"

        trace_config:
          # trace sampling: possible values are `AlwaysOn`, `AlwaysOff`, or
          # `TraceIdRatioBased: number`. The ratio sampler takes a value between 0
          # and 1 and decides on trace creation whether it will be recorded.
          sampler:
            TraceIdRatioBased: 0.42
          max_events_per_span: 1
          max_attributes_per_span: 2
          max_links_per_span: 3
          max_attributes_per_event: 4
          max_attributes_per_link: 5
          resource:
            attrs:
              key1:
                String: value
              key2:
                Bool: true
              key3:
                I64: 42
              key4:
                F64: 42.0
              key5:
                Array:
                  String:
                    - value1
                    - value2
```

### Using OTLP

```yaml title="configuration.yaml"
server:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
plugins:
  apollo.reporting:
    # Optional if you want to enable opentracing propagation headers to your subgraphs
    # opentracing:
      # "zipkin_b3" and "jaeger" formats are supported
      # format: "zipkin_b3"
    # Configuration to send traces and metrics to an OpenTelemetry Protocol compatible service
    opentelemetry:
      otlp:
        tracing:
          exporter:
            # 'http' for OTLP/HTTP, 'grpc' for OTLP/gRPC
            http:
              # URL of the exporter
              endpoint: http://example.com
              # Possible options: 'Grpc' for GRPC protocol and 'HttpBinary' for HTTP protocol with binary protobuf
              protocol: Grpc
              # timmeout in seconds
              timeout: 60
          trace_config:
            # trace sampling: possible values are `AlwaysOn`, `AlwaysOff`, or
            # `TraceIdRatioBased: number`. The ratio sampler takes a value between 0
            # and 1 and decides on trace creation whether it will be recorded.
            sampler:
              TraceIdRatioBased: 0.42
            max_events_per_span: 1
            max_attributes_per_span: 2
            max_links_per_span: 3
            max_attributes_per_event: 4
            max_attributes_per_link: 5
            resource:
              attrs:
                key1:
                  String: value
                key2:
                  Bool: true
                key3:
                  I64: 42
                key4:
                  F64: 42.0
                key5:
                  Array:
                    String:
                      - value1
                      - value2
```
