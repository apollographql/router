### Span events for traces containing errors ([PR #6727](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6727))

We have added new span events to trace spans that include some errors. These span events include the GraphQL error code that relates to the error. So far this only includes errors generated by connectors and the demand control plugin.
