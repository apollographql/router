title: Health checks in the Apollo Router
description: Determining the router's status
---

Health checks are often used by load balancers to determine whether a server is available and ready to start serving traffic.

The Apollo Router supports a basic HTTP-level health check. This is enabled by default and is served at the URL path `/health`. This returns a `200` status code if the HTTP server is successfully serving. It does not invoke any GraphQL execution machinery.
You can change this path by setting `health-check`:
```yaml title="router.yaml"
health-check:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:9494
  path: /health
```
