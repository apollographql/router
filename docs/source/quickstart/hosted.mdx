---

In this tutorial we will set up and run a router in three(3) steps!

If you would like to build and run the router from sources, have a look at the [build and run example](build).

### Prerequisites:

- None! We will use a tarball available [in the Github releases section](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases).

### 1. Download the router binary

Go to the [Apollo router releases section](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases) and download the latest tarball that matches your system. Available systems and architectures are `Linux(x86_64)`, `MacOS(x86_64)` and `Windows(x86_64)`.
If your target system and architecture aren't available, you can [build and run the Apollo router from source](build).

```sh
curl -o router.tar.gz https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/download/v0.1.0-prealpha.3/router-0.1.0-prealpha.3-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
```

### 2. Unzip the router binary

Use your favorite method to unzip the downloaded archive. The archive contains the router (built in `release` mode), and the hello-world configuration.

On linux:

```sh
tar -xczf router.tar.gz
```

### 3. Run the router with the provided configuration

```sh
cd router
./router -p ./hello-world
```

The console output should look as following:

```sh
Nov 02 17:08:09.926  INFO router: Starting Apollo Router
Nov 02 17:08:10.279  INFO router: Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4000 ðŸš€
```

This is it! You can now go to http://127.0.0.1:4000 to open the [Apollo studio explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/) and inspect the graph, and run your first queries using the Apollo federation router!
