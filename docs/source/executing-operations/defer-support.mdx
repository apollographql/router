title: Apollo Router support for @defer
description: Incremental delivery of entity fields

> This feature is currently in **public preview**, available in Apollo Router v1.0 and later.

Queries sent to the Apollo Router can use the `@defer` directive to enable the incremental delivery of response data. This functionality is contained entirely within the router and does _not_ require your subgraphs to also support `@defer`!

## What is `@defer`?

The `@defer` directive ([see the RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md)) enables a client query to specify a set of fields that it doesn't need to receive data for _immediately_. This is helpful whenever some fields in a query take much longer to resolve than others.

Here's an example query that uses `@defer`:

```graphql
query GetPersonAndFriends($personId: ID!) {
  person(id: $personId) {
    # Basic fields (fast)
    id
    name {
      firstName
      lastName
    }

    # highlight-start
    # Friend fields (slower)
    ... on User @defer {
      friends {
        id
      }
    }
    # highlight-end
  }
}
```

When responding to the above query, a GraphQL server can "chunk" its response, starting by returning only the "basic fields". Later, it can return an additional chunk that includes the "friend fields".

As shown, deferred fields are always contained within a GraphQL fragment, and the `@defer` directive is applied to that fragment (_not_ to individual fields).

> To use `@defer` successfully, a GraphQL client _and_ the server it's querying must both support the directive.

## Using `@defer` with the router

The Apollo Router supports deferring the following fields in your schema:

* Fields that are nested anywhere within an [entity type](#entity-fields)
* [Root fields](#root-fields) of the `Query` and `Mutation` types

In most supergraphs, this represents the majority of all fields in the schema. [See an example of unsupported fields.](#unsupported-field-example)

### Entity fields

The Apollo Router supports using `@defer` with fields and nested subfields of [entity types](/federation/entities/) in your federated supergraph. Entities are object types with at least one `@key`, which specifies the fields that can uniquely identify any given instance of that type.

Here's an example subgraph schema that defines a `User` entity:

```graphql title="Users subgraph"
type User @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: Name!
  friends: [User!]!
}

type Name {
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
}

type Query {
  person(id: ID!): User
}
```

Because the `User` type is an entity, a client query can apply `@defer` to any fragment that's nested somewhere within that type (at any depth).

Here are two example queries:

```graphql
query QueryA($personId: ID!) {
  person(id: $personId) {
    id
    # highlight-start
    ... on User @defer {
      name {
        firstName
        lastName
      }
    }
    # highlight-end
  }
}

query QueryB($personId: ID!) {
  person(id: $personId) {
    id
    name {
      firstName
      # highlight-start
      ... on Name @defer {
        lastName
      }
      # highlight-end
    }
  }
}
```

### Root fields

The Apollo Router also supports using `@defer` with root fields of your supergraph's `Query` and `Mutation` types:

```graphql
query PartiallyDeferredQuery {
  products {
    id
  }
  # highlight-start
  ... on Query @defer {
    users {
      id
    }
  }
  # highlight-end
}
```

### Unsupported field example

Let's say our router's supergraph schema includes the following:

```graphql
type Book {
  title: String!
  author: String!
}

type Query {
  books: [Book!]!
}
```

The Apollo Router _cannot_ defer part of this query as requested:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">⚠️</p>

```graphql
query DeferredAuthorQuery {
  books {
    title
    # highlight-start
    ... on Book @defer {
      author # Can't be deferred
    }
    # highlight-end
  }
}
```

This is because `Book.author` is _not_ nested within an entity type. If the `Book` type were an entity, the Apollo Router would be able to defer this field.

Whenever the Apollo Router receives a query with an unsupported use of `@defer`, it resolves the query as though that `@defer` directive were _not_ present.
