description: Migrating to the Apollo Router from @apollo/gateway
---

If you have a federated supergraph that currently uses the Node.js `@apollo/gateway` library, this article describes how to move that supergraph to the Rust-based Apollo Router. We recommend the Apollo Router over `@apollo/gateway` for all supergraphs, because it provides significant performance improvements.

> **Tip**: Moving to the Apollo Router from `@apollo/gateway` requires zero changes to your subgraphs. 

## What's different?

Whereas `@apollo/gateway` is an npm package, the Apollo Router is packaged as a _static, standalone binary_. 

The Apollo Router exposes the most common critical features via declarative configuration. You customize the router with a [YAML configuration file](./configuration/overview/#yaml-config-file) that takes effect at startup. Configurations can be modified and take effect without restart if you either start the router with the `--hot-reload` flag or set the `APOLLO_ROUTER_HOT_RELOAD` environment variable to `true`.

> You _can_ download the Apollo Router source and use it as a library in a larger project. However, our goal is to remove the need to write custom code in your graph router, which is always necessary with `@apollo/gateway`. 

## Take inventory of your gateway configuration

The `@apollo/gateway` library is an extension to the [Apollo Server](/apollo-server/) library, and you need to consider your existing configuration of _both_ gateway and server libraries when moving to the Apollo Router. For example, you might need to consider your customizations for the HTTP headers your subgraphs receive from client requests, or for passing specific headers _back_ to the client from specific subgraphs.

Because the Apollo Router uses an entirely different configuration mechanism, you should make a checklist of your gateway's custom behaviors to make sure those behaviors all remain when your migration is complete.

Start by looking for configuration and customizations in these places:

* Environment variables
* Non-Apollo telemetry and instrumentation (e.g., OpenTelemetry or Datadog)
* Constructor options passed to `new ApolloGateway({ ... })`
* Constructor options passed to `new ApolloServer({ ... })`
* Specific `plugins` passed to `new ApolloServer({ plugins: [ ... ] })`
* Custom middleware (e.g., Express, Koa, Fastify)

The sections below provide more details on what to look for in each of these categories.

## Environment variables

Many Apollo tools use environment variables prefixed with `APOLLO_` to set certain values, such as an API key for communicating with Apollo Studio.

Make sure to note any environment variables you set in your existing gateway's environment, _especially_ those prefixed with `APOLLO_`

The Apollo Router supports the following environment variables used by `@apollo/gateway`:

* `APOLLO_KEY`
* `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`

The Apollo Router **renames** the following environment variables used by `@apollo/gateway`:

* [`APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT`](/federation/managed-federation/uplink/#environment-variable) â†’ `APOLLO_UPLINK_ENDPOINTS`
    * This argument supports providing a comma-separated list of URLs.

## `ApolloGateway` constructor options

The number of options you currently provide to your `ApolloGateway` constructor varies depending on whether you're using [managed federation](/federation/managed-federation/overview/). If you _are_ using managed federation, you might even be providing _zero_ options to this constructor!

### `supergraphSdl`

The [`supergraphSdl` option](/apollo-server/using-federation/api/apollo-gateway/#supergraphsdl) is used in _non_-managed federation to provide a composed supergraph schema via a file or other string. Usually, that schema is composed using the [Rover CLI](/rover/commands/supergraphs/).

You can achieve this option's effect with the Apollo Router in one of the following ways:

* [Move to managed federation](/federation/managed-federation/setup/) with your move to the Apollo Router.
* Provide the `--supergraph` command-line argument to the Apollo Router on startup:

    ```
    ./router --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
    ```

    The router watches this schema file and hot-reloads it whenever it changes.

### `serviceList` / `IntrospectAndCompose`

If you provide one of these constructor options, your gateway performs its _own_ supergraph schema composition on startup. **The Apollo Router does not support this in-process composition.**

Instead, you need to perform composition using [managed federation](/federation/managed-federation/setup/) or the [Rover CLI](/rover/commands/supergraphs/). With either of these methods, the Apollo Router can hot-reload its supergraph schema without restarting, and you avoid the possibility of a composition failure that results in downtime.

### `buildService`

The [`buildService` function](/apollo-server/using-federation/api/apollo-gateway/#buildservice) enables you to customize the HTTP requests that the gateway sends to your subgraphs.

Common use cases include:

* Overriding subgraph URLs at runtime
    * In the Apollo Router, you can use the [`override_subgraph_urls` option](./configuration/overview#subgraph-routing-urls).
* Propagating headers to subgraphs via `RemoteGraphQLDataSource`
    * In the Apollo Router, you can use the [`headers` option](./configuration/header-propagation).

### `logger`

The [`logger` constructor option](/apollo-server/using-federation/api/apollo-gateway/#logger) enables you to specify a different logger for messages that are produced by the `ApolloGateway`. By default, it inherits from the `logger` used by your `ApolloServer` instance.  This option is also useful for changing logging verbosity.

In the Apollo Router, logging is JSON-structured in production environments by default, and you can adjust the verbosity. More advanced logging can be enabled through the use of [plugins](#plugins).

For more information, see [Logging in the Apollo Router](./configuration/logging/).

## `ApolloServer` constructor options

The `ApolloServer` constructor supports a large variety of options, but for the purposes of moving to the Apollo Router, we'll focus on the following:

- `context`
- `plugins`

> For the full list of options, see [`ApolloServer` options](/apollo-server/api/apollo-server#options). If you're using other options, additional steps might be necessary to replicate the same behavior. Please open a discussion on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router) so we can understand your needs and help you with a solution.

### `context`

This constructor option is an object that enables you to propagate information across the request lifecycle. Use cases include:

* Authentication information
* Header propagation

The Apollo Router provides [similar functionality](./customizations/rhai-api#requestcontext).

### `plugins`

This constructor option is an array of built-in or custom `plugins` that extend Apollo Server's functionality. If you provide `plugins` to your `ApolloServer` instance, take note of each plugin's functionality and add it to your migration checklist.

Before you attempt to replicate a plugin's functionality via an Apollo Router [customization](#supported-customizations), check whether any router [configuration options](./configuration/overview/) provide that same functionality. For example, the router supports options for propagating HTTP headers to subgraphs and enabling OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

> If one of your `@apollo/gateway` plugins _does_ require a corresponding router customization, we encourage you to describe your use case in the Router repo's [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/). It might represent core functionality that the Apollo Router _should_ provide out of the box, and we can help discuss the design.
>
> For less common use cases, we also want to help build an ecosystem of shared customizations for the Apollo Router, enabling teams to more quickly add the functionality they need before native support is available.

#### Supported customizations

The Apollo Router currently supports two types of customizations that hook into the request-handling pipeline:

* [Rhai scripts](./customizations/rhai/)
    * Rhai is a scripting language designed for use with Rust applications.
* [External coprocessing](./customizations/coprocessor/)

Examples for each are provided in their respective documentation, and in the [Router repo](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples).
