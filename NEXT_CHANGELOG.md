## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó
## üöÄ Features
### Line precise error reporting [PR #830](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/782)
The router will make a best effort to give line precise error reporting if the configuration was invalid.
```yaml
1. /telemetry/tracing/trace_config/sampler

telemetry:
  tracing:
    trace_config:
      service_name: router3
      sampler: "0.3"
               ^----- "0.3" is not valid under any of the given schemas
```
### Install experience [PR #820](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/820)

  Added an install script that will automatically download and unzip the router into the local directory.
  For more info see the quickstart documentation.

## üêõ Fixes
### Propagate error extensions originating from subgraphs [PR #839](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/839)
Extensions are now propagated following the configuration of the `include_subgraph_error` plugin.

### Telemetry configuration [PR #830](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/830)
Jaeger and Zipkin telemetry config produced JSON schema that was invalid.

### Early return a better error when introspection is disabled [PR #751](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/751)
Instead of returning an error coming from the query planner, we are now returning a proper error explaining that the introspection has been disabled.

### Add operation name to subquery fetches [PR #840](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/840)
If present in the query plan fetch noede, the operation name will be added to sub-fetches.

## üõ† Maintenance
### Configuration files validated [PR #830](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/830)
Router configuration files within the project are now largely validated via unit test.

### Switch web server framework from `warp` to `axum` [PR #751](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/751)

  The router is now running by default with an [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/) web server instead of `warp`.
