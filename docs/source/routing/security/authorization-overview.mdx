APIs provide access to business-critical data. Unrestricted access can result in data breaches, monetary losses, or potential denial of service. Even for internal services, checks can be essential to limit data to authorized parties.

Services may have their own access controls, but enforcing authorization _in the Apollo Router_ is valuable for a few reasons:

- **Optimal query execution**: Validating authorization _before_ processing requests enables the early termination of unauthorized requests. Stopping unauthorized requests at the edge of your graph reduces the load on your services and enhances performance.

  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR;
    clients(Client);
    subgraph Router[" "]
      router(["<b>GraphOS Router</b>"]);
      serviceB[Users<br/>API];
      serviceC[Posts<br/>API];
    end
    router -.->|"‚ùå Subquery"| serviceB & serviceC;
    clients -->|"‚ö†Ô∏èUnauthorized <br/>request"| router;
  ```

  - If every field in a particular subquery requires authorization, the router's [query planner](/router/customizations/overview#request-path) can _eliminate entire subgraph requests_ for unauthorized requests. For example, a request may have permission to view a particular user's posts on a social media platform but not have permission to view any of that user's personally identifiable information (PII). Check out [How it works](/graphos/routing/security/authorization#how-it-works) to learn more.

  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR;
    clients(Client);
    subgraph Router[" "]
      router(["<b>GraphOS Router</b>"]);
      serviceB[Users<br/>API];
      serviceC[Posts<br/>API];
    end
    router -->|"‚úÖ Authorized <br/> subquery"| serviceC;
      router -.->|"‚ùå Unauthorized <br/> subquery"| serviceB;
    clients -->|"‚ö†Ô∏è Partially authorized <br/>request"| router;
  ```

  - Also, [query deduplication](/router/configuration/traffic-shaping/#query-deduplication) groups requested fields based on their required authorization. Entire groups can be eliminated from the query plan if they don't have the correct authorization.

- **Declarative access rules**: You define access controls at the field level, and GraphOS [composes](/graphos/routing/security/authorization#composition-and-federation) them across your services. These rules create graph-native governance without the need for an extra orchestration layer.

- **Principled architecture**: Through composition, the router centralizes authorization logic while allowing for auditing at the service level. This centralized authorization is an initial checkpoint that other service layers can reinforce.

  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR;
    clients(Client);
    Level2:::padding
    subgraph Level1["<br>üîê Router layer&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"]
      router(["<b>GraphOS Router</b>"]);
        subgraph Level2["üîê Service layer"]
          serviceB[Users<br/>API];
          serviceC[Posts<br/>API];
          end
    end

    router -->|"Subquery"| serviceB & serviceC;
    clients -->|"Request"| router;

## How access control works

The GraphOS Router provides access controls via **authorization directives** that define access to specific fields and types across your supergraph:

- The [`@requiresScopes`](/graphos/routing/security/authorization#requiresscopes) directive allows granular access control through the scopes you define.
- The [`@authenticated`](/graphos/routing/security/authorization#authenticated) directive allows access to the annotated field or type for _authenticated requests only_.
- The [`@policy`](/graphos/routing/security/authorization#policy) directive offloads authorization validation to a [Rhai script](/graphos/routing/customization/rhai/) or a [coprocessor](/router/customizations/coprocessor) and integrates the result in the router. It's useful when your authorization policies go beyond simple authentication and scopes.

For example, imagine you're building a social media platform that includes a `Users` subgraph. You can use the [`@requiresScopes`](/graphos/routing/security/authorization#requiresscopes) directive to declare that viewing other users' information requires the `read:user` scope:

```graphql
type Query {
  users: [User!]! @requiresScopes(scopes: [["read:users"]])
}
```

You can use the [`@authenticated`](/graphos/routing/security/authorization#authenticated) directive to declare that users must be logged in to update their own information:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  updateUser(input: UpdateUserInput!): User! @authenticated
}
```

You can define both directives&mdash;together or separately&mdash;at the field level to fine-tune your access controls. When directives are declared both on a field and the field's type, they will all be tried, and the field will be removed if any of them does not authorize it.
GraphOS [composes](/graphos/routing/security/authorization#composition-and-federation) restrictions into the supergraph schema so that each subgraph's restrictions are respected.
The router then enforces these directives on all incoming requests.
