# [0.12.1] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## ❗ BREAKING ❗

### Remove the generic stream type from RouterResponse and ExecutionResponse ([PR #1420](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1420)

This generic type complicates the API with limited benefit because we use BoxStream everywhere in plugins:
* `RouterResponse<BoxStream<'static, Response>>` -> `RouterResponse`
* `ExecutionResponse<BoxStream<'static, Response>>` -> `ExecutionResponse`
