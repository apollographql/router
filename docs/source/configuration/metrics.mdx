## Collecting Metrics

### Using Prometheus

You can use [Prometheus and Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) to collect metrics and visualize the router metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      # By setting this endpoint you enable the prometheus exporter
      # All our endpoints exposed by plugins are namespaced by the name of the plugin
      # Then to access to this prometheus endpoint, the full url path will be `/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus`
      enabled: true
```

Assuming you are running locally:
1. Run a query against the router.
2. Navigate to [http://localhost:4000/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus](http://localhost:4000/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus) to see something like:

```
# HELP http_request_duration_seconds Total number of HTTP requests made.
# TYPE http_request_duration_seconds histogram
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"} 1
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.9"} 1
---SNIP---
```

Note that if you have not run a query against the router you will see a blank page as no metrics will have been generated yet!

### Using OpenTelemetry Collector

You may send metrics to [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) for processing and eporting metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    otlp:
      # Either 'default' or a URL
      endpoint: default
      
      # Optional protocol. Only grpc is supported currently. 
      # Setting to http will result in configuration failure.
      protocol: grpc
      
      # Optional Grpc configuration
      grpc:
        domain_name: "my.domain"
        key:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        ca:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        cert:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        metadata:
          foo: bar
      
      # Optional timeout in humatime form       
      timeout: 2s
```
