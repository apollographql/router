The Apollo Router automatically uses JSON-formatted logging when there is not an interactive shell session attached (e.g., in CI and deployed environments).

## Basic logging via shell

Basic logging is mostly used during local development.

```bash
2022-03-18T10:28:11.090054Z  INFO apollo_router::executable: apollo-router@0.1.0-alpha.9
2022-03-18T10:28:11.160650Z  INFO apollo_router: Starting Apollo Router
2022-03-18T10:28:11.339906Z  INFO apollo_router: Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4000 ðŸš€
```

## JSON-formatted logging:

JSON-formatted logging facilitates compatibility with searchable logging facilities like Google Cloud Logging or Stackdriver. It is preferred for production environments.

```json
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:41.926942Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"apollo-router@0.1.0-alpha.9"},"target":"apollo_router::executable"}
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:41.985121Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Starting Apollo Router"},"target":"apollo_router"}
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:42.171173Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4000 ðŸš€"},"target":"apollo_router"}
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:43.453993Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Stopped"},"target":"apollo_router"}
```
