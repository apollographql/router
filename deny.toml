  # `cargo-scaffold` uses `git2` which uses `libssh2-sys` and `libgit2-sys`.
  # Both require `openssl-sys`. Adding this rule in this way is sufficient to
  # allow those to use `openssl-sys` (not a runtime dependency), leveraging the
  # capabilities of `cargo-deny` to "block" `openssl-sys`.  However, this isn't
  # defensive enough on its own since we could introduce `git2` in
  # `apollo-router` and we would inadvertently get `openssl-sys` and it would
  # _not_ be blocked.  That's bad!  Unfortunately, the `wrappers` technique of
  # `cargo-deny` only enables exceptions for _direct_ dependencies.  To defend
  # against the above risk, we add additional rules here (below) which _only_
  # allows `git2` in `cargo-scaffold`.  This is a bit wonky, since we may at
  # some point want `git2` but does accomplish what we want with the desired
