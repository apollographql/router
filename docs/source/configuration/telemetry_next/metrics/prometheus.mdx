title: Collecting metrics in the Apollo Router
---


## Using Prometheus

You can use [Prometheus and Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) to collect metrics and visualize the router metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      # By setting this endpoint you enable the Prometheus exporter
      # All our endpoints exposed by plugins are namespaced by the name of the plugin
      enabled: true
      listen: 127.0.0.1:9090
      path: /metrics
```
