title: Logging in the Apollo Router
---

import { Link } from "gatsby";

The Apollo Router accepts a command-line argument to set its log level:

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `--log`

</td>
<td>

The log level, indicating the _most_ severe log message type to include. In ascending order of verbosity, can be one of: `off`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace`.

The default value is `info`.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

The router also accepts an `APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG` environment variable with the same possible values as the command-line argument. If you provide _both_, the command-line argument takes precedence.

## Output formats

The Apollo Router supports two logging formats:

- [Basic logging](#basic-logging-via-shell), primarily for local development
- [JSON-formatted logging](#json-formatted-logging), for compatibility with searchable logging tools like Google Cloud Logging

The router uses basic logging whenever an interactive shell session is attached, and it uses JSON-formatted logging otherwise (e.g., in CI and deployed environments). You can also enforce a specific format in configuration.

### Basic logging via shell

Basic logging is mostly used during local development:

```
2022-03-18T10:28:11.090054Z  INFO apollo_router::executable: apollo-router@0.1.0-alpha.9
2022-03-18T10:28:11.160650Z  INFO apollo_router: Starting Apollo Router
2022-03-18T10:28:11.339906Z  INFO apollo_router: Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4000 🚀
```

### JSON-formatted logging

JSON-formatted logging provides compatibility with common searchable logging tools like Google Cloud Logging. The Apollo Router uses the popular Bunyan format:

```json
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:41.926942Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"apollo-router@0.1.0-alpha.9"},"target":"apollo_router::executable"}
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:41.985121Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Starting Apollo Router"},"target":"apollo_router"}
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:42.171173Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4000 🚀"},"target":"apollo_router"}
{"timestamp":"2022-03-18T11:46:43.453993Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"Stopped"},"target":"apollo_router"}
```

## Basic configuration

> This is part of an experimental feature, it means any time until it's stabilized (without the prefix `experimental_`) we might change the configuration shape or adding/removing features.
> If you want to give feedback or participate in that feature feel free to join [this discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/1961).

By default some of our logs containing sensitive data (like request body, response body, headers) are not displayed even if we are in the right log level.
For example if you need to display raw responses from one of your subgraph it won't be displayed by default. To enable them you have to configure it thanks to the `contains_attributes` setting.
Here is an example on how you can configure it:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  experimental_logging:
    format: json # By default it's "pretty" if you are in an interactive shell session
    display_filename: true # Display filename where the log is coming from. Default: true
    display_line_number: false # Display line number in the file where the log is coming from. Default: true
    # If one of these headers matches we will log supergraph and subgraphs requests/responses
    when_header:
      - name: apollo-router-log-request
        value: my_client
        headers: true # default: false
        body: true # default: false
      # log request for all requests coming from Iphones
      - name: user-agent
        match: ^Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone*
        headers: true
```

## Advanced configuration
