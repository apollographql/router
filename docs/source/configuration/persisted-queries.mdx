## Differences from automatic persisted queries

The Apollo Router also supports a related feature called [automatic persisted queries](./in-memory-caching#caching-automatic-persisted-queries-apq) (APQ). With APQ, clients can execute a GraphQL operation by sending the SHA256 hash of its operation string instead of the entire string. **APQ doesn't support safelisting** because the router dynamically populates its APQ cache over time with _any_ operations it receives.

For more details on differences between APQ and this feature, see the [GraphOS persisted queries documentation](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries#differences-from-automatic-persisted-queries).

## Implementation

Enabling operation safelisting has a few steps:

1. PQL creation and linking
1. Router configuration
1. Preregistering trusted operations
1. Client updates

This article details the router configuration step.
For more information on other configuration aspects, see the [GraphOS persisted queries documentation](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries).

## Router configuration

### Configuration options

The router provides four configuration options that you can combine to create the recommended [security levels](#router-security-levels). This section details each configuration option. Refer to the [security levels](#router-security-levels) section for recommended combinations.

#### `preview_persisted_queries`

This base configuration enables the feature. All other configuration options build off this one.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
preview_persisted_queries:
  enabled: true
```

#### `log_unknown`

Adding `log_unknown: true` to `preview_persisted_queries` configures the router to log any incoming operations not preregistered to the PQL.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
preview_persisted_queries:
  enabled: true
  log_unknown: true
```

If used with the [`safelist`](#safelist) option, the router logs unregistered and rejected operations. With [`safelist.required_id`](#require_id) off, the only rejected operations are unregistered ones. If [`safelist.required_id`](#require_id) is turned on, operations can be rejected even when preregistered because they use operation IDs rather than operation strings.

#### `safelist`

Adding `safelist: true` to `preview_persisted_queries` causes the router to reject any operations that haven't been preregistered to your PQL.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
preview_persisted_queries:
  enabled: true
  safelist:
    enabled: true
apq:
  enabled: false
```

> **Note:** To enable safelisting, you _must_ turn off [automatic persisted queries](./in-memory-caching#caching-automatic-persisted-queries-apq) (APQs). APQs let clients [register arbitrary operations at runtime](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries/#differences-from-automatic-persisted-queries) while safelisting restricts operations to those that have been explicitly preregistered.

By default, the [`require_id`](#required_id) suboption is `false`, meaning the router accepts both operation IDs and operation strings as long as the operation is preregistered.

#### `require_id`

Adding `require_id: true` to the `safelist` option causes the router to reject any operations that either:
- haven't been preregistered to your PQL
- use a full operation string rather than the operation ID

```yaml title="router.yaml"
preview_persisted_queries:
  enabled: true
  safelist:
    enabled: true
    require_id: true
apq:
  enabled: false
```
