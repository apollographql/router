### Add ability for router to deal with query plans with contextual rewrites ([PR #5097](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/5097))

Adds the ability for the router to execute query plans with context rewrites on them. These are generated by the @fromContext directive and are used to map a Value in the collected data JSON onto a variable which will in turn be used as an argument to a field resolver.

⚠️ This ships with a new version of federation, 2.8.0, which means distributed caches will be repopulated.
