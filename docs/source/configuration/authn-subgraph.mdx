title: Subgraph Authentication in the Apollo Router
minVersion: 1.27.0
---

The Apollo Router supports subgraph request authentication and key rotation via [AWS Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html) (SigV4).

This allows you to secure communication to AWS subgraphs by making sure a subgraph request was made by the Apollo Router, and the payload hasn't been tampered with.

We have tested the feature against the following services:
  - AWS Lambda URL
  - AWS Appsync
  - AWS Amazon API Gateway
  - VPC Lattice ⚠️ VPC Lattice doesn't support websockets, you won't be able to use Subscriptions in passthrough mode.

**To use this feature:**

To use this feature, your AWS hosted subgraphs must be configured with IAM to accept [signed requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-signing.html).

## How it works

Subgraph requests are signed using [HTTP Authorization headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html), refer to the upstream documentation for more details.

### Configuration example

The example below shows how to use a default credentials chain for all subgraphs, except for the `products` subgraph, which uses  hardcoded credentials:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
authentication:
  subgraph:
    all: # configuration that will apply to all subgraphs
      aws_sig_v4:
        default_chain:
          profile_name: "my-test-profile" # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#ec2-instance-profile
          region: "us-east-1" # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html
          service_name: "lambda" # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html
          assume_role: # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html
            role_arn: "test-arn"
            session_name: "test-session"
            external_id: "test-id"
    subgraphs:
      products:
        aws_sig_v4:
          hardcoded: # Not recommended, prefer using default_chain as shown above
            access_key_id: "my-access-key"
            secret_access_key: "my-secret-access-key"
            region: "us-east-1"
            service_name: "vpc-lattice-svcs" # "s3", "lambda" etc.
```

### Default chain authentication

The default chain authentication method tries to resolve credentials in the following order, starting with environment variables:

| Credential Type                  | Examples                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Environment variables            | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_ROLE_ARN`, `AWS_IAM_ROLE_SESSION_NAME`|
| Shared configurations             | `~/.aws/config`, `~/.aws/credentials`, configured with `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` and `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment variables           |
| Web identity tokens                           | Possibly configured with the `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` environment variable            | `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`
| Elastic Container Service (ECS)                           | Configured with the `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` or `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI`, and `AWS_CONTAINER_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN` environment variables |

#### Assume Role:

Both authentication methods allow you to use the `assume_role` key to use [IAM Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) for given credentials (recommended).
