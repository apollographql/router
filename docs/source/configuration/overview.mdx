> For router installation instructions, see the [quickstart](../quickstart/).

You run the Apollo Router with the following command (assuming you're in the same directory as the `router` executable):

```bash
./router --config router.yaml --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
```

Arguments for this command are described below.

## Environment variables

If you're using the Apollo Router with [managed federation](/federation/managed-federation/overview/), set these environment variables in its startup command:

```bash
APOLLO_KEY="..." APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="..." ./router
```

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Environment Variable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr class="required">
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`

</td>
<td>

The graph ref of the registered Apollo graph and variant that the router fetches its supergraph schema from.

**Required** if using managed federation.

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="required">

</tbody>
</table>

## Command arguments

The `router` command supports the arguments listed in the table below.

Where indicated, some of these arguments can also be set via an environment variable. If you specify a configuration value using _both_ mechanisms, the command-line argument's value takes precedence.

## YAML config file

The Apollo Router takes an optional YAML configuration file as input via the [`--config`](#-c----config) option:

```bash
./router --config router.yaml
```

This file enables you to customize various aspects of your router's behavior, covered in the subsections below.

> If you pass the [`--hot-reload`](#--hr----hot-reload) flag to the `router` command, your router automatically restarts whenever changes are made to its configuration file.

### Listen address

By default, the Apollo Router starts an HTTP server that listens on `127.0.0.1:4000`. You can specify a different address by setting `supergraph.listen`:

#### IPv4

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
  # The socket address and port to listen on
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
```

#### IPv6

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
  # The socket address and port to listen on. 
  # Note that this must be quoted to avoid interpretation as an array in YAML.
  listen: '[::1]:4000'
```

#### Unix socket

> Listening on a Unix socket is not supported on Windows.

```yaml title="router_unix.yaml"
supergraph:
  # Absolute path to a Unix socket
  listen: /tmp/router.sock
```

### Endpoint path

By default, the router starts an HTTP server that exposes a `POST`/`GET` endpoint at path `/`.

You can specify a different path by setting `supergraph.path`:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
  # The path for GraphQL execution
  # (Defaults to /)
  path: /graphql
```

The path must start with `/`.

Path parameters and wildcards are supported. For example:

- `/:my_dynamic_prefix/graphql` matches both `/my_project_a/graphql` and `/my_project_b/graphql`.
- `/graphql/*` matches `/graphql/my_project_a` and `/graphql/my_project_b`.
- `/g*` matches `/graphql` and `/gateway`.

> **Note:** The router does _not_ support wildcards in the _middle_ of a path (e.g., `/*/graphql`). Instead, use a path parameter (e.g., `/:parameter/graphql`).

### Introspection

By default, the router does _not_ resolve introspection queries. You can enable introspection like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
# Do not enable introspection in production!
supergraph:
  introspection: true
```

### Landing pages

The Apollo Router can serve any of the following landing pages to browsers that visit its [endpoint path](#endpoint-path):

- A basic landing page that displays an example query `curl` command (default)

    ```yaml title="router.yaml"
    # This is the default behavior. You don't need to include this config.
    homepage:
      enabled: true
    ```

- _No_ landing page

    ```yaml title="router.yaml"
    homepage:
      enabled: false
    ```

- [Apollo Sandbox](/graphos/explorer/sandbox), which enables you to explore your schema and compose operations against it using the Explorer

    Note the additional configuration required to use Sandbox:

    ```yaml title="router.yaml"
    sandbox:
      enabled: true

    # Sandbox uses introspection to obtain your router's schema.
    supergraph:
      introspection: true

    # Sandbox requires the default landing page to be disabled.
    homepage:
      enabled: false
    ```

    > ⚠️ **Do not enable Sandbox in production!** Sandbox requires enabling introspection, which is strongly discouraged in production environments.

### Subgraph routing URLs

By default, the Apollo Router obtains the routing URL for each of your subgraphs from the composed supergraph schema you provide it. In most cases, no additional configuration is required.

However, if you _do_ need to override a particular subgraph's routing URL (for example, to handle changing network topography), you can do so with the `override_subgraph_url` option:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
override_subgraph_url:
  accounts: http://localhost:8080
```

In this example, the `accounts` subgraph URL is overridden to point to `http://localhost:8080`. The URL specified in the supergraph schema is ignored.

Any subgraphs that are _omitted_ from `override_subgraph_url` continue to use the routing URL specified in the supergraph schema.

### HTTP header rules

See [Sending HTTP headers to subgraphs](./header-propagation/).

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

See [Configuring CORS in the Apollo Router](./cors).

### Defer support

See [Apollo Router support for `@defer`](../executing-operations/defer-support/#disabling-defer).

### External extensibility

See [External extensibility in the Apollo Router](./external).

### OpenTelemetry tracing

See [Tracing in the Apollo Router](./tracing/).

### Automatic persisted queries (APQ)

Automatic Persisted Queries (APQ) enable GraphQL clients to send a server the _hash_ of their query string, _instead of_ sending the query string itself. When query strings are very large, this can significantly reduce network usage.

The Apollo Router supports using APQ in its communications with both clients _and_ subgraphs:

- **In its communications with clients,** the router acts as a GraphQL server, because it receives queries from clients.
- **In its communications with subgraphs,** the router acts as a GraphQL _client_, because it _sends_ queries to subgraphs.

Because the router's role differs between these two interactions, you configure these APQ settings separately.

#### APQ with clients

The Apollo Router automatically supports APQ with clients via its in-memory cache. See the [caching documentation](./caching) for related options.

You can _disable_ this APQ support like so:

```yaml
supergraph:
  apq:
    enabled: false
```

#### APQ with subgraphs

By default, the Apollo Router does _not_ use APQ when sending queries to its subgraphs.

You can configure this APQ support with a combination of global and per-subgraph settings:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
  apq:
    subgraph:
      # Disable subgraph APQ globally unless overridden per-subgraph
      all:
        enabled: false
      # Override global APQ setting for individual subgraphs
      subgraphs:
        products:
          enabled: true
```

In the example above, subgraph APQ is disabled _except for_ the `products` subgraph.

> For more information on APQ, including client configuration, see [this article](/apollo-server/performance/apq/).

### TLS

TLS connections to subgraphs are verified using the list of certificate authorities provided by the system. You can override this list with a combination of global and per-subgraph settings:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
tls:
  subgraph:
    # Use these certificate authorities unless overridden per-subgraph
    all:
      certificate_authorities: "${file./path/to/ca.crt}"
    # Override global setting for individual subgraphs
    subgraphs:
      products:
        certificate_authorities: "${file./path/to/product_ca.crt}"
```

### Plugins

You can customize the Apollo Router's behavior with [plugins](../customizations/overview). Each plugin can have its own section in the configuration file with arbitrary values:

```yaml {4,8} title="example-plugin-router.yaml"
plugins:
  example.plugin:
    var1: "hello"
    var2: 1
```

### Variable expansion

You can reference variables directly in your YAML file. This is useful for referencing secrets without including them in the file.

Currently, the Apollo Router supports expansion of environment variables and file paths. Corresponding variables must be prefixed with `env.` or `file.`

The router uses Unix-style expansion. Here are some examples:

- `${env.ENV_VAR_NAME}` expands to the value of environment variable `ENV_VAR_NAME`.
- `${env.ENV_VAR_NAME:-some_default}` expands to the value of environment variable `ENV_VAR_NAME`, or falls back to the value `some_default` if the environment variable is not defined.
- `${file.a.txt}` expands to the contents of the file `a.txt`.
- `${file.a.txt:-some_default}` expands to the contents of the file `a.txt`, or falls back to the value `some_default` if the file does not exist.

Variable expansions are valid only for YAML _values_, not keys:

<!-- TODO: Add back doc config validation when https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1374 is fixed -->
```yaml
supergraph:
  listen: "${env.MY_LISTEN_ADDRESS}" #highlight-line
example:
  password: "${env.MY_PASSWORD}" #highlight-line
```

### Reusing configuration

You can reuse parts of your configuration file in multiple places using standard YAML aliasing syntax:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
headers:
  subgraphs:
    products:
      request:
        - insert: &insert_custom_header
            name: "custom-header"
            value: "something"
    reviews:
      request:
        - insert: *insert_custom_header
```

Here, the `name` and `value` entries under `&insert_custom_header` are reused under `*insert_custom_header`.

## Configuration awareness in your text editor

The Apollo Router can generate a JSON schema for config validation in your text editor. This schema helps you format the YAML file correctly and also provides content assist.

Generate the schema with the following command:

```bash
./router config schema > configuration_schema.json
```

After you generate the schema, configure your text editor. Here are the instructions for some commonly used editors:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings)
- [Emacs](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-yaml)
- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/json.html#ws_json_using_schemas)
- [Sublime](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-yaml)
- [Vim](https://github.com/Quramy/vison)

## Upgrading your router configuration

New releases of the Apollo Router might introduce breaking changes to the [YAML config file's](#yaml-config-file) expected format, usually to extend existing functionality or improve usability.

**If you run a new version of your router with a configuration file that it no longer supports:**

1. The router emits a warning on startup.
2. The router attempts to translate your provided configuration to the new expected format.
    - If the translation succeeds without errors, the router starts up as usual.
    - If the translation fails, the router terminates.

If you encounter this warning, you can use the `router config upgrade` command to see the new expected format for your existing configuration file:

```bash
./router config upgrade <path_to_router.yaml>
```

You can also view a diff of exactly which changes are necessary to upgrade your existing configuration file:

```bash
./router config upgrade --diff <path_to_router.yaml>
```
