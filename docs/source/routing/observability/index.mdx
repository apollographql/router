Apollo GraphOS provides the observability signals and tools your team needs to maintain the health and performance of your deployed supergraphs. By default, GraphOS Router automatically [reports operation and field usage metrics to GraphOS Studio](/graphos/platform/insights/sending-operation-metrics#from-the-apollo-router-or-apollo-server).

If you need more data than what GraphOS collects by default, you can declaratively configure your router to collect and export additional telemetry to your observability tools.

If you're new to observability, check out [OpenTelemetry's observability primer](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer/) to learn core observability concepts.

## Analyzing metrics and gathering insights with GraphOS

Everything connected to GraphOS—including clients, routers, and subgraphs—can report metrics about GraphQL operations they send and service. GraphOS thus is the hub for collecting operation metrics.

Once operation and field usage metrics are collected by GraphOS, you can use the GraphOS Studio [**Insights**](/graphos/platform/insights) suite to visualize and analyze them to understand your supergraph's usage and performance.

Additionally, you can forward the metrics that GraphOS collects to your APM solution. Apollo offers a [Datadog integration](/graphos/platform/insights/datadog-forwarding) to forward your graph's performance metrics to your Datadog account.

<EnterpriseFeature>

The following require an [Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/):

<br />
<br />

- Connecting a self-hosted router to GraphOS
- Forwarding metrics to Datadog

<br />

Reporting metrics from [Apollo Server](/apollo-server) or a [monograph](/graphos/get-started/concepts/graphs/#monographs) requires an [Enterprise or legacy Team plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing).

If your organization doesn't currently have an Enterprise plan, you can test out this functionality by signing up for a free [GraphOS trial](https://studio.apollographql.com/signup?referrer=docs-content).

## Enabling additional telemetry

Both the GraphOS Router and Apollo Router Core run a request-handling pipeline with multiple stages that starts with receiving requests and ends with sending back responses. The continuous operation and throughput of this request pipeline, or _request lifecycle_, reflects the health of a running supergraph. Observability of the router request lifecycle is therefore key to understanding the health of a supergraph.

To enable observability, the router supports telemetry that can be added and customized in every stage of the router request lifecycle. You can add logs, metrics, and traces, and you can export them to your application performance monitoring (APM) solution.
