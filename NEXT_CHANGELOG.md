# [0.9.3] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## ❗ BREAKING ❗

## 🚀 Features

- **Measure APQ cache hits and registers** ([PR #1117](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1117))

  The APQ layer will now report cache hits and misses to Apollo Studio if telemetry is configured

## 🐛 Fixes

- **Prevent memory leaks when tasks are cancelled** [PR #767](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/767)

  Cancelling a request could put the router in an unresponsive state where the deduplication layer or cache would make subgraph requests hang.

## 🛠 Maintenance
### Unpin schemars version [#1074](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1074)
The Schemars 0.8.9 caused compile errors due to it validating default types.
This change has however been rolled back upstream.
We can now safely depend on schemars 0.8.10.
