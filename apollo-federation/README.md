Apollo Federation
-----------------------------
Apollo Federation is an architecture for declaratively composing APIs into a unified graph. Each team can own their slice of the graph independently, empowering them to deliver autonomously and incrementally.

Federation 2 is an evolution of the original Apollo Federation with an improved shared ownership model, enhanced type merging, and cleaner syntax for a smoother developer experience. Itâ€™s backwards compatible, requiring no major changes to your subgraphs.

Checkout the [Federation 2 docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation) and [demo repo](https://github.com/apollographql/supergraph-demo-fed2) to take it for a spin and [let us know what you think](https://community.apollographql.com/t/announcing-apollo-federation-2/1821)!
