The **Apollo Router** is a configurable, high-performance **graph router** for a federated graph. It slots into any existing [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/) architecture (v1 or v2), replacing your Node.js gateway that uses the `@apollo/gateway` library:

```mermaid
flowchart BT;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph " ";
  gateway(["Apollo Router<br/>(replaces @apollo/gateway)"]);
  serviceA[Users<br/>subgraph];
  serviceB[Products<br/>subgraph];
  serviceC[Reviews<br/>subgraph];
  gateway --- serviceA & serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.- gateway;
  class clients secondary;
```

 The Apollo Router is [implemented in Rust](https://github.com/apollographql/router), which provides [performance benefits](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/backend/apollo-router-our-graphql-federation-runtime-in-rust/) over Node.js.
