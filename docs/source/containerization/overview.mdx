title: Containerizing the Apollo Router

> More details about Apollo Router images are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/router).

Each release of the Apollo Router includes both default and debug images. Each image for a release contains the same build. Debug images have helpful debugging utilities installed and run the router under the control of heaptrack (https://github.com/KDE/heaptrack).

<ElasticNotice />

Here's a basic example of running a router image with Docker (make sure to replace `<image version>` with whichever version you want to use, such as `v1.4.0`):

```bash title="Docker"
docker run -p 4000:4000 \
  --env APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="<your graph>" \
  --env APOLLO_KEY="<your key>" \
  --rm \
  ghcr.io/apollographql/router:<image version>
```

This command downloads your supergraph schema from Apollo and uses a default configuration that listens for connections on port `4000`.

For more complex configuration (such as overriding subgraph URLs or propagating headers), see [Configuring the Apollo Router](../configuration/overview/).

For examples of using router images in specific environments, see the guides for [Docker](./docker/) and [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

## Image file layout

* The router executable is located in the `/dist` directory.
* A default configuration file, `router.yaml`, is located in the `dist/config` directory.
* There is also a `/dist/schema` directory for convenient mounting of a locally defined supergraph schema.
* Licensing details are also available in the `/dist` directory.

## Image build

Apollo Router images are based on [debian:bullseye-slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/), which is designed to provide constrained, secure, and small images.
