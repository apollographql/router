TODO

In a federated graph, your gateway is responsible for the following tasks:

1. Receiving incoming GraphQL operations from clients
2. Generating a **query plan** for each operation based on the **supergraph schema**
3. Using an operation's query plan to execute it across one or more **subgraphs**
4. Collecting subgraph responses and assembling them into a _single_ response for the requesting client
