# [1.8.0] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Remove timeout from otlp exporter ([Issue #2337](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2337))

`batch_processor` configuration contains timeout, so the existing timeout property has been removed from the parent configuration element.

Before:
```yaml
telemetry:
  tracing:
    otlp:
      timeout: 5s
```
After:
```yaml
telemetry:
  tracing:
    otlp:
      batch_processor:
        timeout: 5s
```

## üöÄ Features

### Add support for single instance Redis ([Issue #2300](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2300))

For `experimental_cache` with redis caching it now works with only a single Redis instance if you provide only one URL.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Simplify telemetry config code ([Issue #2337](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2337))

This brings the telemetry plugin configuration closer to standards recommended in the [yaml design guidance](dev-docs/yaml-design-guidance.md).
