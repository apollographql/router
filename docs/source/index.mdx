**The Apollo Router** is a configurable, high-performance **graph router** for a federated supergraph. You can use it with any [Apollo Federation](/federation/) architecture (v1 or v2):

```mermaid
flowchart BT;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph " ";
  gateway(["Apollo Router"]);
  serviceA[Users<br/>subgraph];
  serviceB[Products<br/>subgraph];
  serviceC[Reviews<br/>subgraph];
  gateway --- serviceA & serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.- gateway;
  class clients secondary;
```

 The Apollo Router is [implemented in Rust](https://github.com/apollographql/router), which provides [performance benefits](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/backend/apollo-router-our-graphql-federation-runtime-in-rust/) over the Node.js `@apollo/gateway` library.
 
If you have an existing supergraph that currently uses `@apollo/gateway`, you can move to the Apollo Router without changing any other part of your supergraph.
