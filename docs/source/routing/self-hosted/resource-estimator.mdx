The _router resource estimator_ estimates the system resources you need to allocate for the GraphOS Router to run production traffic. The resource estimator can help you get a starting baseline that you can then iterate on.

## Usage

To use the estimator:

1. Enter your estimated **request rate per second** and **peak request rate per second**.
2. Adjust the other parameters to match your estimated production load.
   - When selecting the **number of instances**, select fewer for efficiency, more for safety.
3. Be sure to test and iterate.
