title: Health checks in the Apollo Router
description: Determining the router's status
---

Health checks are often used by load balancers to determine whether a server is available and ready to start serving traffic.

The Apollo Router supports a basic HTTP-level health check. This is enabled by default and is served at the URL path `/.well-known/apollo/server-health`. This returns a `200` status code if the HTTP server is successfully serving. It does not invoke any GraphQL execution machinery.
You can change this path by setting `server.health_check_path`:
```yaml title="router.yaml"
server:
  health_check_path: /health
```
