## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Remove timeout from otlp exporter ([Issue #2337](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2337))

`batch_processor` configuration contains timeout, so the existing timeout property has been removed from the parent configuration element.

Before:
```yaml
telemetry:
  tracing:
    otlp:
      timeout: 5s
```
After:
```yaml
telemetry:
  tracing:
    otlp:
      batch_processor:
        timeout: 5s
```

## üêõ Fixes

### Change the default value of `apollo.field_level_instrumentation_sampler` ([Issue #2339](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2339))

### `subgraph_request` span is set as the parent of traces coming from subgraphs ([Issue #2344](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2344))

Before this fix, the context injected in headers to subgraphs was wrong, it was not the right parent span id.

### Move APQ and EnsureQueryPresence in the router service ([PR #2296](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2296))

Moving APQ from the axum level to the supergraph service reintroduced a `Buffer` in the service pipeline.
Now the APQ and`EnsureQueryPresence ` layers are part of the router service, to remove that `Buffer`.
