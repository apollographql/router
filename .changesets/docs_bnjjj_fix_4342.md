### Document `experimental_when_header` logging configuration option ([Issue #4342](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/4342))

In the router v1.35.0, the experimental logging configuration option `experimental_when_header` was supported but not documented. Its documentation has been added [here](https://apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/logging/overview#requestresponse-logging).
