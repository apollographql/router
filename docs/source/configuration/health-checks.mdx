title: Health checks in the Apollo Router
description: Determining the router's status
---

Health checks are often used by load balancers to determine whether a server is available and ready to start serving traffic.

The Apollo Router supports a basic HTTP-level health check. This is enabled by default and is served on port `8088` at the URL path `/health`. This returns a `200` status code if the HTTP server is successfully serving.
You can change this by setting `health_check`:
```yaml title="router.yaml"
health_check:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:8088
  enabled: true
  path: /health # Optional, default: /health
```

Each option is configurable. For example, we can set our health check endpoint to `127.0.0.1:8090/healthz`:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
health_check:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:8090
  enabled: true
  path: /healthz
```

We can also disable the health check endpoint:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
health_check:
  enabled: false
```

## Testing with `curl`

The following example demonstrates using the `curl` command to send a basic health check query to an Apollo Router instance running at `127.0.0.1:4000`:

```sh
$ curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:8088/health"
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8088...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8088 (#0)
> GET /health HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:8088
> User-Agent: curl/7.79.1
> Accept: */*
> 
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< vary: origin
< content-type: application/json
< content-length: 15
< date: Wed, 21 Sep 2022 17:10:45 GMT
< 
* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
{"status":"UP"}
```

## Logging

If you start the router with trace logging enabled, you will see a log from the router for each health check:

```sh
--log apollo_router=trace

2023-01-23T17:42:04.640501Z apollo-router/src/axum_factory/axum_http_server_factory.rs:100 TRACE apollo_router::axum_factory::axum_http_server_factory: health check health=Health { status: Up } request=Request { method: GET, uri: /health, version: HTTP/1.1, headers: {"host": "127.0.0.1:8088", "user-agent": "curl/7.85.0", "accept": "*/*"}, body: Body(Empty) }

```

This may be helpful with confirming that health-checks are working correctly.

## Using in a containers environment

The health check listens to 127.0.0.1 by default, which won't allow connections issued from a network.
While this is a safe default, *other containers won't be able to perform health checks*, which will prevent the router pod from switching to a healthy state.

You can change this by setting `health_check`:
```yaml title="router.yaml"
health_check:
  listen: 0.0.0.0:8088
  enabled: true
```

## Using with Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, you can configure health checks by setting `readinessProbe` and `livenessProbe` on the `containers` object of the resource definition:
```yaml
      # ... snipped for partial example ...
      containers:
        - name: router
          # ... snipped for partial example ...
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: "/health"
              port: 8088
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: "/health"
              port: 8088
          # ... snipped for partial example ...
```
See a more complete example in our [Kubernetes documentation](../containerization/kubernetes/).
## Using with Docker
Docker has a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction that tells Docker how to test whether a container is still working. These are defined in the `Dockerfile` when building your container:
```
HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8088/health" || exit 1
```
We don't define these in our example `Dockerfile`s, because they aren't commonly used. You can add them to your own images as needed.
