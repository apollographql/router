subtitle: How to deploy the router on your own infrastructure
description: Distribute operations efficiently across microservices in your federated GraphQL API with the Apollo GraphOS Router or Apollo Router Core. Configure caching, security features, and more.

A self-hosted GraphOS Router or Apollo Router Core enables you to fully manage the runtime infrastructure and deployments of your supergraph.

```mermaid

  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";

For each version of the Apollo Router, Apollo provides:

- [A Helm chart for Kubernetes](#kubernetes-using-helm)
- [A binary](#local-binary)
- [A Docker image](#container)

## Kubernetes Using Helm
>>>>>>> 20aaf5a1 (draft: changes to the kubernetes docs)

Apollo provides a binary of the router for multiple platforms. You can download the router bundle, extract the router binary, and run it. 

## Kubernetes using Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Apollo provides a Helm chart with each release of Apollo Router in the GitHub Container Registry. Since router v0.14.0, Apollo has released each router Helm chart as an Open Container Initiative (OCI) image in `oci://ghcr.io/apollographql/helm-charts/router`.

Follow our [Kubernetes quickstart](/graphos/routing/kubernetes/quickstart) to deploy the router with a Helm chart.

## Docker

Apollo provides Docker images for each release of Apollo Router. The images are available via GitHub, downloadable from the `ghcr.io/apollographql/router` and the [router repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/router). Both debug and production images are provided.

For more information on deploying using your container environment:

- [Docker](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker)
- [AWS using Elastic Container Service (ECS)](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/aws)
- [Azure using Azure Container App](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/azure)
- [GCP using Google Cloud Run](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/gcp)

## Local binary

Running the Apollo Router directly from its binary speeds up local development and enables embedded use cases where containers are unavailable. 

Follow the [quickstart](/graphos/routing/get-started) to run a router binary.
