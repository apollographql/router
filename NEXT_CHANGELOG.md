## ❗ BREAKING ❗
## 🚀 Features ( :rocket: )

### helm chart now supports prometheus metrics [PR #1005](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1005)
The router has supported exporting prometheus metrics for a while. This change updates our helm chart to enable router deployment prometheus metrics. 

Configure by updating your values.yaml or by specifying the value on your helm install command line.

e.g.: helm install --set router.configuration.telemetry.metrics.prometheus.enabled=true <etc...>

Note: prometheus metrics are not enabled by default in the helm chart.
