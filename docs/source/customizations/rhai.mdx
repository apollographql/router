title: Rhai script plugins for the Apollo Router
description: Extend router functionality without compiling a custom plugin
---

> ⚠️ Apollo Router support for Rhai scripting is currently experimental. For details, see [experimental limitations](#experimental-limitations).

The Apollo Router provides experimental support for plugins that use the [Rhai](http://rhai.rs) scripting language. Rhai is useful for performing common script-based tasks (manipulating strings, processing headers, etc.) in a Rust-based project.

Rhai plugins hook into the same Apollo Router lifecycle events as [native Rust plugins](./native/).

## Experimental limitations

Like the rest of the Apollo Router, Rhai support is in active development. During this preview, functionality is limited.

**What you can do:**
* Manipulate request HTTP headers

**What you can't do (yet):**
* Execute calls to external services
* Modify the body or status codes of requests/responses
* Perform `checkpoint`-style short circuiting of requests

We might introduce breaking changes to Rhai script functionality prior to the full release of the Apollo Router. However, any required updates to your existing plugins will probably be minor.

## Configuration

```yaml
plugins:
  experimental.rhai:
    # Currently there can only be a single rhai file.  If there are multiple
    # customizations, keep them all in a single file.
    filename: "location_of_your_rhai_script.rhai"
```

## Service hooks

As with native plugins, there are 4 services, each with a request and a response, which can be used to inject extra behaviour into a router. The Rhai plugin implements eight functions (two for each service) as follows:

    - router_service_request
    - router_service_response
    - query_planning_service_request
    - query_planning_service_response
    - execution_service_request
    - execution_service_response
    - subgraph_service_request
    - subgraph_service_response

Each of these functions are optional, just implement the ones where you wish to inject behaviour. Every listed function takes a `context` as parameter with `extensions` and `headers` inside and must return a `context`.

## Examples

### Example 1

This example manipulates headers and the request context:

```javascript
fn router_service_request(context) {
    // Verify that x-custom-header is present and has the expected value
    if context.headers["x-custom-header"] != "CUSTOM_VALUE" {
        throw "Error: you did not provide the right custom header";
    }
    context
}

fn router_service_response(context) {
    context.headers["test-header"] = "here is a test";
    if context.headers["x-custom-header"] == "CUSTOM_VALUE" {
        context.headers.greetings = "hello";
    }
    let value = context.extensions.test + 10;
    context.headers["coming_from_extensions"] = `value_${value}`;
    context.extensions.test = 42;
    context.extensions.addition = "Here is a new element in the context";

    context
}
```

### Example 2

This example converts cookies into headers for transmission to subgraphs. There is a complete working example (with tests) of this in the [examples/cookies-to-headers directory](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples/cookies-to-headers).

```javascript
// This converts all cookie pairs into headers.
// If you only want to convert certain cookies, you
// can add logic to modify the processing.
fn subgraph_service_request(context) {
    // Find our cookies
    let cookies = context.headers["Cookie"].split(';');
    for cookie in cookies {
        // Split our cookies into name and value
        let k_v = cookie.split('=', 2);
        if k_v.len() == 2 {
            // trim off any whitespace
            k_v[0].trim();
            k_v[1].trim();
            // update our headers
            context.headers[k_v[0]] = k_v[1];
        }
    }
    // Always return the context
    context
}
```
