### Disable Deno snapshotting on docs.rs

This works around [V8 linking errors](https://docs.rs/crate/apollo-router/1.0.0-rc.2/builds/633287).

### Add the Uplink schema to the repository, with a test checking that it is up to date.

Previously it was downloaded at compile-time, 
which would [fail](https://docs.rs/crate/lets-see-if-this-builds-on-docs-rs/0.0.1/builds/633305) 
in build environments without Internet access.
If an update is needed, the test failure prints a message with the command to run.
