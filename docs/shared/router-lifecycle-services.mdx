The Apollo Router's request lifecycle has three major services:

* **Router service** - Handles an incoming request before it is parsed. Works within a context of opaque bytes.
* **Supergraph service** - Handles a request after it has been parsed and before it is sent to the subgraph. Works within a GraphQL context.
* **Subgraph service** - Handles a request after it has been sent to the subgraph. Works within a GraphQL context.
