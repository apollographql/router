## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Removed unused `Request::from_bytes()` from public API ([Issue #1855](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1855))

We've removed `Request::from_bytes()` from the public API.  We were no longer using it and we don't expect anyone external to have been relying on it.

We discovered this function during an exercise of documenting our entire public API.  While we considered keeping it, it didn't necessarily meet our requirements for shipping it in the public API.  It's internal usage was removed in [`d147f97d`](https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/d147f97d as part of [PR #429](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/429).

We're happy to consider re-introducing this in the future (it even has a matching `Response::from_bytes()` which it composes against nicely!), but we thought it was best to remove it for the time-being.

## üöÄ Features

### Reintroduce health liveliness check ([Issue #1861](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1861))

Depending on their environments and cloud settings, users may or may not be able to craft health probes that are able to make CSRF compatible GraphQL queries.
This is one of the reasons why we reintroduced a health check in the router.

The health liveness check endpoint is exposed on `127.0.0.1:8088/health`, and its listen address can be changed in the yaml configuration:

```yaml
health-check:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:8088 # default
  enabled: true # default
```

## üêõ Fixes

### update and validate configuration files ([Issue #1854](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1854))

Several of the dockerfiles in the router repository were out of date with respect to recent configuration changes. This fix extends our configuration testing range and updates the configuration files.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Disable Deno snapshotting on docs.rs

This works around [V8 linking errors](https://docs.rs/crate/apollo-router/1.0.0-rc.2/builds/633287).

By [@SimonSapin](https://github.com/SimonSapin) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1847

### Add the Uplink schema to the repository, with a test checking that it is up to date.

Previously it was downloaded at compile-time, 
which would [fail](https://docs.rs/crate/lets-see-if-this-builds-on-docs-rs/0.0.1/builds/633305) 
in build environments without Internet access.
If an update is needed, the test failure prints a message with the command to run.
