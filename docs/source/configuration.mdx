> For installation instructions, see the [quickstart](../quickstart/).

You run Apollo Router with the following command (assuming you're in the same directory as the `router` executable):

```bash
./router --config configuration.yaml --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
```

Options are described below.

The absolute or relative path to the router's [supergraph schema](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/#federated-schemas).

To learn how to compose your supergraph schema with the Rover CLI, see the [Federation quickstart](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/quickstart/#3-compose-the-supergraph-schema).

**Required** unless you provide this value via the `SCHEMA_PATH` environment variable.

##### `-c` / `--config`

The absolute or relative path to the router's optional [YAML configuration file](#configuration-file).

You can also provide this value via the `CONFIGURATION_PATH` environment variable.

## Handling CORS

If you attempt to query Apollo Router from a browser-based client, your request might be rejected due to CORS policies.

You can configure CORS in the [YAML configuration file](#configuration-file) you can provide to Apollo Router.

Here's an example configuration for adding `localhost` to the list of approved origins:

```yaml
# examples/nodejs/configuration.yaml
server:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
  cors:
    origins:
      - https://studio.apollographql.com
      - http://localhost
```

## Configuration file

Apollo Router takes an optional YAML configuration file as input via the `--config` option. All supported configuration options are listed below:

```yaml:title=configuration.yaml
# Configuration of the router's HTTP server
server:
  # The socket address and port to listen on
  # Defaults to 127.0.0.1:4000
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000

  # Cross origin request headers
  cors:
    # Set to false to disallow any origin and rely exclusively on `origins`
    # Defaults to true
    allow_any_origin: true
    # List of accepted origins
    origins:
      - https://studio.apollographql.com
    # Set to true to add the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header
    allow_credentials: false
    # The headers to allow.
    # Defaults to the required request header for Apollo Studio: Content-Type
    allow_headers: [ Content-Type ]
    # Allowed request methods
    # Defaults to GET, POST, OPTIONS.
    methods: [ GET, POST, OPTIONS ]
    # Which response headers should be made available to scripts running in the browser,
    # in response to a cross-origin request.
    expose_headers:

# Names and URLs of all subgraphs
# By default, this information is parsed from the supergraph schema
# Provide it here to override subgraph names or URLs
subgraphs:
  # Defines a subgraph named "accounts"
  accounts:
    # The URL of the accounts subgraph's GraphQL endpoint
    routing_url: http://localhost:4001/graphql
  # Defines a second subgraph named "products"
  products:
    routing_url: http://localhost:4003/graphql

    # defaults to router
    service_name: "router"
