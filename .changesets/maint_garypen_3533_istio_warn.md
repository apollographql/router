### Add a warning if we think istio-proxy injection is causing problems ([Issue #3533](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/3533))

We have encountered situations where the injection of istio-proxy in a router pod (executing in Kubernetes) causes networking errors during uplink retrieval.

The root cause is that the router is executing and attempting to retrieve uplink schemas while the istio-proxy is simultaneously modifying network configuration.

This new warning message directs users to information which should help them to configure their Kubernetes cluster or pod to avoid this problem.
