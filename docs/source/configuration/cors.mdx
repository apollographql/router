If you attempt to query the Apollo Router from a browser-based client, your request might be rejected due to CORS policies.

You can configure CORS in the [YAML configuration file](#configuration-file) you provide to the Apollo Router.

Here's an example configuration for adding `localhost` to the list of approved origins:

```yaml
# examples/nodejs/configuration.yaml
server:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
  cors:
    origins:
      - https://studio.apollographql.com
      - http://localhost
```
