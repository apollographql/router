title: Configuring CORS in the Apollo Router
subtitle: Control browser access to your router
description: Manage browser access to your Apollo Router with CORS configuration options, including origin whitelisting, wildcard origins, and credential passing.

<Note> 

**This article describes CORS configuration that's specific to the Apollo Router**. For a more general introduction to CORS and common considerations, see the following sections:

* [Why use CORS?](/apollo-server/security/cors#why-use-cors)
* [Choosing CORS options for your project](/apollo-server/security/cors#choosing-cors-options-for-your-project)

</Note>

By default, the Apollo Router enables _only_ GraphOS Studio to initiate browser connections to it. If your supergraph serves data to other browser-based applications, you need to do one of the following in the `cors` section of your router's [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file):

* Add the origins of those web applications to the router's list of allowed `origins`.
    * Use this option if there is a known, finite list of web applications that consume your supergraph.
* Add a regex that matches the origins of those web applications to the router's list of allowed `origins`.
    * This option comes in handy if you want to match origins against a pattern, see the example below that matches subdomains of a specific namespace.
* Enable the `allow_any_origin` option.
    * Use this option if your supergraph is a public API with arbitrarily many web app consumers.
    * With this option enabled, the router sends the [wildcard (`*`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin#directives) value for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. This enables _any_ website to initiate browser connections to it (but they can't provide cookies or other credentials).

* If clients need to [authenticate their requests with cookies](#passing-credentials), you _must_ use either `origins`, `match_origins`, or the combination of both options. When using both options, note that `origins` is evaluated before `match_origins`.

The following snippet includes an example of each option (use either `allow_any_origin`, or `origins` and/or `match_origins`):

```yaml title="router.yaml"
cors:

  # Set to true to allow any origin
  # (Defaults to false)
  allow_any_origin: true

  # List of accepted origins
  # (Ignored if allow_any_origin is true)
  # (Defaults to the GraphOS Studio url: `https://studio.apollographql.com`)
  #
  # An origin is a combination of scheme, hostname and port.
  # It does not have any path section, so no trailing slash.
  origins:
    - https://www.your-app.example.com
    - https://studio.apollographql.com # Keep this so GraphOS Studio can run queries against your router
  match_origins:
    - "^https://([a-z0-9]+[.])*api[.]example[.]com$" # any host that uses https and ends with .api.example.com
```

You can also disable CORS entirely by setting `origins` to an empty list:

```yml title="router.yaml"
cors:
  origins: []
```

If your router serves exclusively _non_-browser-based clients, you probably don't need to modify the default CORS configuration.

## Passing credentials

If your router requires requests to [include a user's credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#requests_with_credentials) (e.g., via cookies), you need to modify your CORS configuration to tell the browser those credentials are allowed.

You can enable credentials with CORS by setting the [`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials) HTTP header to `true`.

To allow browsers to pass credentials to the Apollo Router, set `allow_credentials` to `true`, like so:

```yaml {6} title="router.yaml"
cors:
  origins:
    - https://www.your-app.example.com
    - https://studio.apollographql.com
  allow_credentials: true
```

<Tip> 

**To support credentialed requests, your router's config file must specify individual `origins`**. If your router enables `allow_any_origin`, your browser will refuse to send credentials.

</Tip>

Additionally, you'll need to configure the router to forward the [`Cookie`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cookie) header to some (or all) of your subgraphs:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
headers:
  all:
    request:
      - propagate:
          named: cookie
```

For examples of sending cookies and authorization headers from Apollo Client, see [Authentication](/react/networking/authentication/).


## All `cors` options

The following snippet shows all CORS configuration defaults for the Apollo Router:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
#
# CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
#
cors:

  # Set to true to allow any origin
  allow_any_origin: false

  # List of accepted origins
  # (Ignored if allow_any_origin is set to true)
  #
  # An origin is a combination of scheme, hostname and port.
  # It does not have any path section, so no trailing slash.
  origins:
    - https://studio.apollographql.com # Keep this so GraphOS Studio can still run queries against your router

  # Set to true to add the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header
  allow_credentials: false

  # The headers to allow.
  # Not setting this mirrors a client's received `access-control-request-headers`
  # This is equivalent to allowing any headers,
  # except it will also work if allow_credentials is set to true
  allow_headers: []

  # Allowed request methods
  methods:
    - GET
    - POST
    - OPTIONS

  # Which response headers are available to scripts running in the
  # browser in response to a cross-origin request.
  expose_headers: []

  # Adds the Access-Control-Max-Age header
  # Can be set to a duration in time units 
  # If not set, the header is not included
  max_age: 2h
```

## Response `Vary` header

A plugin may set a response `Vary` header. If, after all plugins are processed, there is no response `Vary` header, then the router will add one with a value of "origin".
