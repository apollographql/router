# [0.9.5] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd
## ❗ BREAKING ❗
## 🚀 Features ( :rocket: )

### Add support of multiple uplink URLs [PR #1210](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1210)
Add support of multiple uplink URLs with a comma-separated list in `APOLLO_UPLINK_ENDPOINTS` and for `--apollo-uplink-endpoints`

Example: 
```bash
export APOLLO_UPLINK_ENDPOINTS="https://aws.uplink.api.apollographql.com/, https://uplink.api.apollographql.com/"
```

### Add support for adding extra enviromental variables and volumes to helm chart
The following example will allow you to mount your supergraph.yaml into the helm deployment using a configmap with a key of supergraph.yaml. Using [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) to generate your configmap from your supergraph.yaml is suggested.

Example:
```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: APOLLO_ROUTER_SUPERGRAPH_PATH
    value: /etc/apollo/supergraph.yaml
    # sets router log level to debug
  - name: APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG
    value: debug
extraEnvVarsCM: ''
extraEnvVarsSecret: ''

extraVolumes:
  - name: supergraph-volume
    configMap:
      name: some-configmap 
extraVolumeMounts: 
  - name: supergraph-volume
    mountPath: /etc/apollo
```

### Support introspection object types ([PR #1240](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1240))

Introspection queries can use a set of object types defined in the specification. The query parsing code was not recognizing them,
resulting in some introspection queries not working.
