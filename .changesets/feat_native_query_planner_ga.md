### Native query planner is now generally available 

The router now uses a native, rust-based, query planner by default.

In our testing across a variety of graphs, we observed the following
improvements with the native query planner:

* 10x [median] improvement in query planning time (observed via `apollo.router.query_planning.plan.duration`)
* 2.9x improvement in router’s CPU utilisation
* 2.2x improvement in router’s memory usage 

It is expected that the generated plans and subgraph operations in the native
query planner will have slight differences when compared to the legacy query
planner. These differences have been ascertained as semantically insignificant
by comparing ~2.5 million all known unique user operations in GraphOS as well as
comparing ~630 million operations across actual router deployments in shadow
mode over the period of last 4 months.

The legacy, JavaScript, query planner is deprecated in this release, and will be
removed in the upcoming 1.60.0. In 1.59.0, however, you can still switch
back to legacy query planner with:

```
experimental_query_planner_mode: legacy
```

> Note: The subgraph operations generated by the query planner are not
guaranteed consistent release over release. We strongly recommend against
relying on the shape of planned subgraph operations, as new router features and
optimizations will continuously affect it.
