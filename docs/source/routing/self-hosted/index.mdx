title: Self-Hosting the Apollo Router
subtitle: How to deploy the router on your own infrastructure
---

Apollo Router is a graph runtime that you can deploy in your own infrastructure.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["<b>Router</b>"]);
  serviceB[Products<br/>API];
  serviceC[Reviews<br/>API];
  router -->|Sub-query| serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.->|Query| router;
  class clients secondary;
```

For each version of the Apollo Router, Apollo provides:

- [A Helm chart for Kubernetes](#kubernetes-using-helm)
- [A Docker image](#container)
- [A binary](#local-binary)

## Kubernetes using Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Apollo provides a Helm chart with each release of Apollo Router in the GitHub Container Registry. Since router v0.14.0, Apollo has released each router Helm chart as an Open Container Initiative (OCI) image in `oci://ghcr.io/apollographql/helm-charts/router`.

Follow our [Kubernetes quickstart](/graphos/routing/kubernetes/quickstart) to deploy the router with a Helm chart.

## Docker

### Apollo Runtime Container (Recommended)

Apollo provides the Apollo Runtime Container, which bundles all that's required to run the Apollo Runtime in one place. This includes the Apollo Router and the [Apollo MCP Server](/apollo-mcp-server).

The images are available via GitHub, downloadable from `ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-runtime` and the [Apollo Runtime Container repository](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-runtime).

For more information on deploying using your container environment:

- [Docker](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker)

### Router only container

This image is recommended only for Kubernetes-based deployments, and is used by the [Helm chart](/router/containerization/kubernetes/). For more information on deploying using your container environment:

- [Docker](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker-router-only)
- [AWS using Elastic Container Service (ECS)](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/aws)
- [Azure using Azure Container App](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/azure)
- [GCP using Google Cloud Run](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/gcp)

## Local binary

Running the Apollo Router directly from its binary speeds up local development and enables embedded use cases where containers are unavailable. 

Follow the [quickstart](/graphos/routing/get-started) to run a router binary.
