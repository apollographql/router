subtitle: Configure the New Relic exporter for metrics
description: Configure the New Relic exporter for metrics via OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) in the Apollo GraphOS Router or Apollo Router Core.
---

Enable and configure the [OTLP exporter](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/metrics/otlp) for metrics in the GraphOS Router or Apollo Router Core for use with [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/).

For general tracing configuration, refer to [Router Metrics Configuration](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/metrics/overview).

## New Relic configuration

To configure the router, enable the [OTLP exporter](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/metrics/otlp#configuration) with `temporality: delta` and the appropriate endpoint and New Relic API key.

<Note>

For New Relic, `temporality: delta` must be set and the value of the `endpoint` **must** end with `/v1/metrics`.  The example below uses a common default for New Relic.  Check your New Relic account to verify the correct value as the actual domain may vary by region.

</Note>

For example: 

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    metrics:
      otlp:
        enabled: true
        protocol: grpc

        # Temporality MUST be set to delta. Failure to do this will result in incorrect metrics.
        temporality: delta

        # Ensure the endpoint provided ends with "/v1/metrics"
        # Be sure to use the correct URL for your region.
        endpoint: https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317/v1/metrics
        grpc:
          metadata:
            api-key: "<new-relic-api-key>"
```
