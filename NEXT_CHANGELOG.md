# [0.9.5] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd
## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Rhai plugin `request.sub_headers` renamed to `request.subgraph.headers` [PR #1261](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1261)

Rhai scripts previously supported the `request.sub_headers` attribute so that subgraph request headers could be
accessed. This is now replaced with an extended interface for subgraph requests:

```
request.subgraph.headers
request.subgraph.body.query
request.subgraph.body.operation_name
request.subgraph.body.variables
request.subgraph.body.extensions
request.subgraph.uri.host
request.subgraph.uri.path
```

## üöÄ Features

### Add support of multiple uplink URLs [PR #1210](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1210)
Add support of multiple uplink URLs with a comma-separated list in `APOLLO_UPLINK_ENDPOINTS` and for `--apollo-uplink-endpoints`

Example: 
```bash
export APOLLO_UPLINK_ENDPOINTS="https://aws.uplink.api.apollographql.com/, https://uplink.api.apollographql.com/"
```

### Add support for adding extra enviromental variables and volumes to helm chart [PR #1245](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1245)

The following example will allow you to mount your supergraph.yaml into the helm deployment using a configmap with a key of supergraph.yaml. Using [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) to generate your configmap from your supergraph.yaml is suggested.

Example:
```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: APOLLO_ROUTER_SUPERGRAPH_PATH
    value: /etc/apollo/supergraph.yaml
    # sets router log level to debug
  - name: APOLLO_ROUTER_LOG
    value: debug
extraEnvVarsCM: ''
extraEnvVarsSecret: ''

extraVolumes:
  - name: supergraph-volume
    configMap:
      name: some-configmap 
extraVolumeMounts: 
  - name: supergraph-volume
    mountPath: /etc/apollo
```

## üêõ Fixes

### Support introspection object types ([PR #1240](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1240))

Introspection queries can use a set of object types defined in the specification. The query parsing code was not recognizing them,
resulting in some introspection queries not working.

### Create the ExecutionResponse after the primary response was generated ([PR #1260](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1260))

The `@defer` preliminary work has a surprising side effect: when using methods like `RouterResponse::map_response`, they are
executed before the subgraph responses are received, because they work on the stream of responses.
This PR goes back to the previous behaviour by awaiting the primary response before creating the ExecutionResponse.

## üìö Documentation

### Update README link to the configuration file  ([PR #1208](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1208))

As the structure of the documentation has changed, the link should point to the `YAML config file` section of the overview.
