## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Preserve Plugin response Vary headers([PR #1660](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1297))

It is now possible to set a `Vary` header in a client response from a plugin.

Note: This is a breaking change because the prior behaviour provided three default Vary headers and we've had to drop those to enable this change. If, after all plugin processing, there is no Vary header, the router will add one with a value of "origin".

### Fix the supported defer specification version to 20220824 ([PR #1652](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1652))

Since the router will ship before the `@defer` specification is done, we
add a parameter to the `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers to indicate
which specification version is accepted.

The specification is fixed to [graphql/graphql-spec@01d7b98](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/commit/01d7b98f04810c9a9db4c0e53d3c4d54dbf10b82)

The router will now return a response with the status code `406 Not Acceptable` if the `Accept` header does not match.

### Change default enablement and promote `experimental_defer_support` to `preview_defer_support` ([PR #1673](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1673))

Following up on a tremendous amount of work tracked in https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/80 - which brought various stages of `@defer` support to the Router - this changes our designation of its status from "Experimental" to "Preview".  It's worth noting that the specification *just* graduated to "Stage 2 (Draft)" mode in the GraphQL Working Group, so changes may still be expected and there are two stages ahead.  To help things progress:

- We've lifted the previous requirement that users opt into defer support by setting `experimental_defer_support: true` in the `server` section of their configuration.  It is now on by default.
- The option is now called `preview_defer_support` and it can be set to `false` to _specifically_ opt out of it existing at all.  This might be desired if you would prefer that it not even show up in introspection or be possible to use even if a client requests it.
- Using `@defer` support _requires_ clients set the appropriate HTTP `accept` header to use it.  This puts the burden of understanding the risks of an early-preview on the clients who will need to consume the Router's responses. This is particularly important for clients who have long-lived support requirements (like native mobile apps).

  To see which headers are required, see https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1648.

## üöÄ Features

### router now provides TraceId ([PR #1663](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1536))

If you need a reliable way to link together the various stages of pipeline processing, you can now use

```
apollo_router::tracer::TraceId
```

## üêõ Fixes

### Docker images: Use absolute path for `ENTRYPOINT` ([PR #1684](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1684))

This restores the absolute path in `ENTRYPOINT` in our `Dockerfile`s (and published images) to allow users to change their working directory without consequence (and without needing to change it back to `/dist` or override the `entrypoint`).

### Update our helm documentation to illustrate how to use our registry ([#1643](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1643))

The helm chart never used to have a registry, so our docs were really just placeholders. I've updated them to reflect the fact that we now store the chart in our OCI registry.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1649

### Update router-bridge to `query-planner` v2.1.1 ([PR #1650](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1650) [PR #1672](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1672))

The 2.1.0 release of the query planner comes with fixes to fragment interpretation and reduced memory usage.
The 2.1.1 release of the query planner fixes an issue with the `@defer` directive's `if` argument being ignored.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1650 and https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1672

### Do not nullify the entire query if the root operation is not present ([PR #1674](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1674))

if a root field was not returned by the subgraph (example: when
there's an error), we should not nullify the entire data objet. Instead,
it's the root field that should be null (unless it is non
nullable).

### Propagate graphql response regardless of the subgraph HTTP status code. ([#1664](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1664))

Subgraph service calls used to return an error when the received HTTP status code isn't 200.
There's however no mention in the GraphQL specification that leads us to assume any intent behind the HTTP status code returned by a GraphQL server.

This commit removes our HTTP status code check in the subgraph_service.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Remove cache layer ([PR #1647](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1647))

We removed ServiceBuilderExt::cache in 0.16.0. That was the only consumer of
the cache layer. This completes the removal by deleting the cache layer.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1647

### Refactor `SupergraphService` ([PR #1615](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1615))

The `SupergraphService` code became too complex, so much that `rustfmt` could not modify it anymore.
This breaks up the code in more manageable functions.
