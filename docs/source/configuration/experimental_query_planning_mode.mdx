title: Experimental Query Planning Mode 
subtitle: Switch between legacy and native query planning
noIndex: true
---

The router (GraphOS Router and Apollo Router Core) is in the early stages of
transitioning to a native query planner, replacing the existing legacy planner.

As part of the efforts to ensure correctness and stability of the new planner,
v1.53.0 of the router enables both planners to run in parallel in order to
compare them. After the comparison, the router discards the native planner's results and
uses only the legacy planner to execute requests.

The native planner uses a single thread in the cold path of the router. It has a
bounded queue of 10 queries. If the queue is full, the router simply does not run the
comparison to avoid excessive resource consumption.

You can disable the native query planner by configuring your `router.yaml` to use just
`legacy` planning. You may want to disable it to avoid spikes in CPU utilization, for
example if an erroneous operation fails to complete planning in the native planner's
background thread.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
experimental_query_planner_mode: legacy
```

The supported modes of `experimental_query_planner_mode` are the following:
* `new`. Enables only the native query planner.
* `both_best_effort` - default. Enables comparison between legacy and new native
   query planners. The legacy query planner is used for execution. If any
   unsupported features are detected, the router falls back to legacy with an
   `info` log.
* `legacy`. Enables only the legacy query planner.
