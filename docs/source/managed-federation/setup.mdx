This article describes how to set up Apollo Studio for a graph that uses Apollo Federation.

> As with all changes, you should first set up managed federation in a non-production environment, such as staging. To support this, you can use [variants](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/schema/registry/#managing-environments-with-variants), which are distinct versions of the same graph for different environments.

## 1. Get started

If you haven't yet, complete the first two steps from the Apollo Studio getting started guide:

1. [Create your account](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/getting-started/#1-create-your-account)
2. [Create your first graph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/getting-started/#2-create-your-first-graph)

> In the [Register your schema](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/getting-started/#3-register-your-schema) step, make sure you follow the instructions for a GraphQL server that uses Apollo Federation.

## 2. Register all subgraph schemas

## 3. Modify your Apollo Router startup (if necessary)

If you've already set up Apollo Federation _without_ Apollo Studio, you're probably passing a `--supergraph` (or `-s`) flag in the command (e.g., in container startup scripts) you use to start the Apollo Router:

```sh
router --config ./router.yaml --supergraph ./your-local-supergraph.graphql
```

Your configuration file might use a different name, but the `--supergraph` option is specific to _non_-managed federation, in which supergraph schema composition is performed via the Rover CLI and provided as a file.

With managed federation, composition is instead performed by _Apollo_, and the router regularly polls Apollo for an updated schema. This enables you to add, remove, and modify your subgraphs via Apollo Studio's registry _without_ needing to restart your router.

When starting the Apollo Router and retrieving the schema from the Apollo Studio registry, remove the `--supergraph` (or `-s`) argument from your Apollo Router startup command, leaving the `--config` argument if it was already provided:

```sh
router --config ./router.yaml
```

## 4. Connect the router to Studio

Your router uses a graph API key to identify itself to Studio.

<ObtainGraphApiKey />

After obtaining your graph API key, you set two environment variables in your environment when starting your router:

```sh
APOLLO_KEY=<YOUR_GRAPH_API_KEY> APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=<YOUR_GRAPH_ID>@<VARIANT> router --config ./router.yaml
```

The `--config` argument may be present if you were previously passing the operational configuration file to the router and the configuration may use a different name.

The `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variable tells the Apollo Router which variant of which graph to use (for example, `my-graph-id@production`). You can find your variant's graph ref at the very top of its README page in Studio.

## 5. Start the Router

You can now deploy your modified router to begin fetching your federated schema from Studio instead of directly from your subgraphs.

On startup, your router will use its API key to fetch its federation config from Apollo. It can then begin executing operations across your subgraphs.
