title: Overriding subgraph routing URLs
description: Overriding the default subgraph URLs used during query execution.

import { Link } from 'gatsby';

By default, the router uses subgraph URLs defined in the supergraph schema during composition, either in Apollo Studio or in Rover.  In this case, there is usually no further configuration needed.

In the event that you need to override the URL that is provided - for example, to account for changing network topography - you can change override specific subgraphs configuration in your [YAML configuration file](#configuration-file).

## Example

In this example the `accounts` subgraph URL is overridden to point to `http://localhost:8080` and the value which was specified during composition in either Apollo Studio or Rover will be ignored.

```yaml
override_subgraph_url:
  accounts: http://localhost:8080
```
