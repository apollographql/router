The Apollo Router provides experimental support for request authentication via [JSON Web Token](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519) (JWT). This feature uses the popular [jsonwebtoken Rust library](https://crates.io/crates/jsonwebtoken), which supports a variety of signature algorithms.

## How it works

These are the high-level steps of JWT-based authentication with the Apollo Router:

1. Whenever a client authenticates with your system, your identity provider (or a similar service) issues that client a valid JSON Web Token (JWT).
2. In all followup requests to your supergraph, the authenticated client provides its JWT in a designated HTTP header.
3. Whenever your router receives a client request, it extracts the JWT from the designated header (if it's present).
4. Your router validates the extracted JWT using a corresponding [JSON Web Key](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517) (JWK).
    - Your router obtains all of its known JWKs from a URL that you specify in its configuration file. This URL must provide all keys within a single JSON object called a [JWK Set](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517#section-5) (or a JWKS).
    - JWT validation fails if the token is malformed, or if it's been expired for more than 60 seconds (this window accounts for synchronization issues).

5. The router extracts all **claims** from the validated JWT and includes them in the request's context, which makes them available to [router customizations](../customizations/overview/). This enables customizations to handle the request differently depending on the details of those claims ([see below](#accessing-jwt-claims-from-the-context)).

## Setup

You enable JWT authentication in your router's [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file), under the `authentication.experimental` key:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
authentication:
  experimental:
    jwt:
      jwks_url: https://dev-zzp5enui.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json
      # These are the DEFAULT values for the following keys:
      header_name: Authorization
      header_value_prefix: Bearer
      cooldown: 15s
```

The following configuration options are supported:

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Option</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr class="required">
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `jwks_url`

</td>
<td>

**Required.** The URL of the JWK Set (JWKS) that the router should use. Can be an `https://` or a `file://` URL.

**If _any_ of your JWKs uses a symmetric signature algorithm (such as `HS256`), always use a `file://` URL.** Symmetric signature algorithms use a shared key that should never be accessible over the network.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `header_name`

</td>
<td>

The name of the HTTP header that client requests will use to provide their JWT to the router. Must be a valid name for an HTTP header.

The default value is `Authorization`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `header_value_prefix`

</td>
<td>

The string that will always precede the JWT in the header value corresponding to [`header_name`](#header_name). This value must not include whitespace.

The default value is `Bearer`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `cooldown`

</td>
<td>

The frequency at which the router fetches an up-to-date JWK Set from [`jwks_url`](#jwks_url). In almost all cases, you don't need to set a custom value for this option.

The default value is `15s`.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

## Accessing JWT claims from the context

After the Apollo Router validates a client request's JWT, it adds that token's **claims** to the request's context at the key `apollo_authentication::JWT::claims`.

This enables you to define custom logic for handling a request based on the details of the JWT's claims. You can define this logic as a Rhai script or a native Rust plugin. For details on these, see [Customizations for the Apollo Router](../customizations/overview/).

Here's an example of a Rhai script that throws distinct errors for different invalid JWT claim details:

```rhai title="jwt_claims.rhai"
fn process_request(request) {
    try {
        // Note: APOLLO_AUTHENTICATION_JWT_CLAIMS is a Rhai-scope constant with
        // value `apollo_authentication::JWT::claims`
        let claims = request.context[APOLLO_AUTHENTICATION_JWT_CLAIMS];
        if claims == () {
            throw #{
                status: 401,
                message: "No claims presented in this request"
            };
        }
        if !claims.contains("iss") {
            throw #{
                status: 401,
                message: "No issuer presented in this request"
            };
        }
        if claims["iss"] != "https://idp.local" {
            throw #{
                status: 401,
                message: `Issuer ${claims.iss} is not accepted here`
            };
        }
        // Happy path: We have valid claims from the correct idP.
        // Proceed accordingly (in this case, we just log the claims).
        print(`claims: ${claims}`);
    }
    catch(err)
    {
        // log any errors
        log_error(`Error during claims processing: ${err}`);
        throw err;
    }
}
```

## Propagating JWTs to subgraphs

Because clients provide their JWT via an HTTP header, you can propagate JWTs to some or all of your subgraphs using the Apollo Router's general-purpose [header propagation settings](./header-propagation).


## Observability

If your router enables [tracing](./tracing/), the JWT authentication plugin has its own tracing span, named `authentication plugin`.

If your router enables [metrics collection via Prometheus](./metrics/#using-prometheus), the JWT authentication plugin provides and exports the following metrics:

- `apollo_authentication_failure_count`
- `apollo_authentication_success_count`
- `apollo_authentication_cooldown_count`

Those metrics have the following shapes:

```
# HELP apollo_authentication_failure_count apollo_authentication_failure_count
# TYPE apollo_authentication_failure_count counter
apollo_authentication_failure_count{kind="JWT",service_name="apollo-router"} 1

# HELP apollo_authentication_success_count apollo_authentication_success_count
# TYPE apollo_authentication_success_count counter
apollo_authentication_success_count{kind="JWT",service_name="apollo-router"} 11

# HELP apollo_authentication_cooldown_count apollo_authentication_cooldown_count
# TYPE apollo_authentication_cooldown_count counter
apollo_authentication_cooldown_count{kind="JWT",service_name="apollo-router"} 3
```
