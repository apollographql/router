title: Sending Apollo Router usage data to Apollo Studio
---

The Apollo Router can transmit usage data to Apollo Studio via a reporting agent called **Spaceport**.

## Enabling usage reporting

You can enable usage reporting in the Apollo Router by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
export APOLLO_KEY=<YOUR_GRAPH_API_KEY>
export APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=<YOUR_GRAPH_ID>@<VARIANT>
```

More information on usage reporting is available in the [Studio documentation](/studio/metrics/usage-reporting/).

## Enabling field-level instrumentation

[Apollo field-level instrumentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/metrics) (also known as FTV1 tracing) is set to a sampling rate of `0.01` by default, which means it will request traces for 1% of traffic.  To change it to a higher rate, set the `field_level_instrumentation_sampler` value to a rate higher than `0.1`. To completely disable it, set it to `always_off`.

> **Note**
> Since field-level instrumentation is _dependent_ OpenTelemetry tracing, it is necessary to set the `sampler` value for traces to a value the _same or higher_ than the `field_level_instrumentation_sampler` value.

The following example sets both Apollo field-level tracing and OpenTelemetry tracing to attempt to sample 50% of requests:


```yaml
telemetry:
  apollo:
    # This example will trace half of requests. This number can't
    # be higher than tracing.trace_config.sampler.
    field_level_instrumentation_sampler: 0.5
  tracing:
    trace_config:
      # FTV1 uses the same trace sampling as other tracing options,
      # so this value must be set as well.
      sampler: 0.5
```

Note that `field_level_instrumentation_sampler` may not sample at a greater rate than `trace_config.sampler`.

## Advanced configuration

### `send_headers`

Provide this field to configure which request header names and values are included in trace data that's sent to Apollo Studio. Valid options are: `only` with an array, `except` with an array, `none`, `all`.

The default value is `none`, which means no header names or values are sent to Studio. This is a security measure to prevent sensitive data from leaving your infrastructure unless you specifically opt into it

### `send_variable_values`

Provide this field to configure which variable values are included in trace data that's sent to Apollo Studio. Valid options are: `only` with an array, `except` with an array, `none`, `all`.

The default value is `none`, which means no variable values are sent to Studio. This is a security measure to prevent sensitive data from leaving your infrastructure unless you specifically opt into it.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  apollo:
    # The percentage of requests will include HTTP request and response headers in traces sent to Apollo Studio.
    # This is expensive and should be left at a low value.
    # This cannot be higher than tracing->trace_config->sampler
    field_level_instrumentation_sampler: 0.01 # (default)

    # Include HTTP request and response headers in traces sent to Apollo Studio
    send_headers: # other possible values are all, only (with an array), except (with an array), none (by default)
      except: # Send all headers except referer
        - referer

    # Include variable values in Apollo in traces sent to Apollo Studio
    send_variable_values: # other possible values are all, only (with an array), except (with an array), none (by default)
      except: # Send all variable values except for variable named first
        - first
  tracing:
    trace_config:
      sampler: 0.5 # The percentage of requests that will generate traces (a rate or `always_on` or `always_off`)
```
