import { Link } from 'gatsby';

**The Apollo Router** is a configurable, high-performance router for a [self-hosted supergraph](/graphos/graphs/overview/#self-hosted-supergraphs):

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  gateway(["Apollo Router"]);
  serviceB[Products<br/>subgraph];
  serviceC[Reviews<br/>subgraph];
  gateway --- serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.- gateway;
  class clients secondary;
```
 
If you have an existing self-hosted supergraph that currently uses `@apollo/gateway`, you can move to the Apollo Router without changing any other part of your supergraph.

    Try out the Apollo Router!
