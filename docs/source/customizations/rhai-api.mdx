title: Rhai script API reference
description: For Apollo Router customizations
---

This reference documents the symbols and behaviors that are specific to [Rhai customizations](./rhai/) for the Apollo Router.

## Entry point hooks

Your Rhai script's [main file](./rhai/#the-main-file) hooks into the individual services of the Apollo Router's [request-handling lifecycle](./rhai/#router-request-lifecycle). To do so, it defines whichever combination of the following entry point hooks it requires:

```rhai
fn router_service(service) {}
fn supergraph_service(service) {}
fn execution_service(service) {}
fn subgraph_service(service, subgraph) {}
```

Within each hook, you define custom logic to interact with the current active request and/or response as needed. This most commonly involves using methods of the provided `service` object to [register service callbacks](./rhai/#service-callbacks), like so:

```rhai title="main.rhai"
fn supergraph_service(service) {
  let request_callback = |request| {
      print("Supergraph service: Client request received");
  };
  
  let response_callback = |response| {
      print("Supergraph service: Client response ready to send");
  };

  service.map_request(request_callback);
  service.map_response(response_callback);
}
```

## Logging

If your script logs a message with Rhai's built-in `print()` function, it's logged to the Apollo Router's logs at the "info" level:

```rhai
print("logged at the info level");
```

For more control over a message's log level, you can use the following functions:

```rhai
log_error("error-level log message");
log_warn("warn-level log message");
log_info("info-level log message");
log_debug("debug-level log message");
log_trace("trace-level log message");
```

## Terminating client requests

Your Rhai script can terminate the associated client request that triggered it. To do so, it throws an exception. This returns an `Internal Server Error` to the client with a `500` response code.

For example:
```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    // Define a closure to process our response
    let f = |response| {
        // Something goes wrong during response processing...
        throw "An error occurred setting up the supergraph_service...";
    };
    // Map our response using our closure
    service.map_response(f);
}
```

If you wish to have more control over the HTTP status code returned to the client, then you can throw an error which is an objectmap with keys: status and message.

The key must be a number and the message must be something which can be converted to a string.

For example:
```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    // Define a closure to process our response
    let f = |response| {
        // Something goes wrong during response processing...
        throw #{
            status: 400,
            message: "An error occurred processing the response..."
        };
    };
    // Map our response using our closure
    service.map_response(f);
}
```

You can also `throw` a valid GraphQL response, which will be deserialized and dealt with by the router.

For example:
```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    // Define a closure to process our request
    let f = |request| {
        // Something goes wrong during request processing...
        throw #{
            status: 403,
            body: #{
                errors: [#{
                    message: `I have raised a 403`,
                    extensions: #{
                        code: "ACCESS_DENIED"
                    }
                }]
            }
        };
    };
    // Map our request using our closure
    service.map_request(f);
}
```

Rhai throws at the `map_request` layer behave the same as `ControlFlow::Break`, which is explained in the [external extensibility section](./coprocessor/#terminating-a-client-request).

If the supplied status code is not a valid HTTP status code, then a `500` response code will result.

## Timing execution

Your Rhai customization can use the global `Router.APOLLO_START` constant to calculate durations. This is similar to `Epoch` in Unix environments.

```rhai
// Define a closure to process our response
// Note: We can't use a closure in this example because we are referencing our global Router during function execution
fn process_response(response) {
    // highlight-start
    let start = Router.APOLLO_START.elapsed;
    // Do some processing here...
    let duration = Router.APOLLO_START.elapsed - start;
    print(`response processing took: ${duration}`);
    // highlight-end

    // Log out any errors we may have
    print(response.body.errors);
}

fn supergraph_service(service) {
    const response_callback = Fn("process_request");
    service.map_response(response_callback);
}
```

## Accessing the SDL

Your Rhai customization can use the global `Router.APOLLO_SDL` constant to examine the supergraph.

```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    print(`${Router.APOLLO_SDL}`);
}
```

## Accessing a TraceId

Your Rhai customization can use the function `traceid()` to retrieve an opentelemetry span id. This will throw an exception if a span is not available, so always handle exceptions when using this function.

```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    try {
        let id = traceid();
        print(`id: ${id}`);
    }
    catch(err)
    {
        // log any errors
        log_error(`span id error: ${err}`);
    }
}
```

## url encode/decode strings

Your Rhai customization can use the functions `urlencode()` and `urldecode()` to encode/decode strings. `encode()` does not fail, but `decode()` can fail, so always handle exceptions when using the `decode()` function.

```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    let original = "alice and bob";
    let encoded = urlencode(original);
    // encoded will be "alice%20and%20bob"
    try {
        let and_back = urldecode(encoded);
        // and_back will be "alice and bob"
    }
    catch(err)
    {
        // log any errors
        log_error(`urldecode error: ${err}`);
    }
}
```

## json encode/decode strings

Your Rhai customization can use the functions `json::encode()` and `json::decode()` to convert Rhai objects to/from valid JSON encoded strings. Both functions can fail, so always handle exceptions when using them.

```rhai
fn router_service(service) {
    let original = `{"valid":"object"}`;
    try {
        let encoded = json::decode(original);
        // encoded is a Rhai object, with a property (or key) named valid with a String value of "object"
        print(`encoded.valid: ${encoded.valid}`);
        let and_back = json::encode(encoded);
        // and_back will be a string == original.
        if and_back != original {
            throw "something has gone wrong";
        }
    }
    catch(err)
    {
        // log any errors
        log_error(`json coding error: ${err}`);
    }
}
```

## base64 encode/decode strings

Your Rhai customization can use the functions `base64::encode()` and `base64::decode()` to encode/decode strings. `encode()` does not fail, but `decode()` can fail, so always handle exceptions when using the `decode()` function.

```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    let original = "alice and bob";
    let encoded = base64::encode(original);
    // encoded will be "YWxpY2UgYW5kIGJvYgo="
    try {
        let and_back = base64::decode(encoded);
        // and_back will be "alice and bob"
    }
    catch(err)
    {
        // log any errors
        log_error(`base64::decode error: ${err}`);
    }
}
```
<Note>

You don't need to import the "base64" module. It is imported in the router.

</Note>

### Different alphabets

Base64 supports multiple alphabets to encode data, depending on the supported characters where it is used. The router supports the following alphabets:
* `STANDARD`: the "base64" encoding as defined in [RFC 4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4). This is the default when not specified
* `STANDARD_NO_PAD`: the "base64" encoding as defined in [RFC 4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4) without the padding (`=` or `==` characters at the end)
* `URL_SAFE`: the "base64url" encoding as defined in [RFC 4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5)
* `URL_SAFE_NO_PAD`: the "base64url" encoding as defined in [RFC 4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5) without the padding (`=` or `==` characters at the end)

To use them, we can add an argument to the `encode` and `decode` methods:

```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    let original = "alice and bob";
    let encoded = base64::encode(original, base64::URL_SAFE);
    // encoded will be "YWxpY2UgYW5kIGJvYgo="
    try {
        let and_back = base64::decode(encoded, base64::URL_SAFE);
        // and_back will be "alice and bob"
    }
    catch(err)
    {
        // log any errors
        log_error(`base64::decode error: ${err}`);
    }
}
```

## sha256 hash strings

Your Rhai customization can use the function `sha256::digest()` to hash strings using the SHA256 hashing algorithm.

```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service){
    service.map_request(|request|{
        let sha = sha256::digest("hello world");
        log_info(sha);
    });
}
```
<Note>

You don't need to import the "sha256" module. It is imported in the router.

</Note>

## Headers with multiple values

The simple get/set api for dealing with single value headers is sufficient for most use cases. If you wish to set multiple values on a key then you should do this by supplying an array of values.

If you wish to get multiple values for a header key, then you must use the `values()` fn, NOT the indexed accessor. If you do use the indexed accessor, it will only return the first value (as a string) associated with the key.

Look at the examples to see how this works in practice.

## Unix timestamp

Your Rhai customization can use the function `unix_now()` to obtain the current Unix timestamp in seconds since the Unix epoch. 

```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    let now = unix_now();
}
```

## Unique IDs (UUID)

Your Rhai customization can use the function `uuid_v4()` to obtain a UUIDv4 ID.
 
```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    let id = uuid_v4();
}
```

## Environment Variables

Your Rhai customization can access environment variables using the `env` module. Use the `env::get()` function.

```rhai
fn router_service(service) {
    try {
        print(`HOME: ${env::get("HOME")}`);
        print(`LANG: ${env::get("LANG")}`);
    } catch(err) {
        print(`exception: ${err}`);
    }
}
```

<Note>

* You don't need to import the "env" module. It is imported in the router.
* `get()` may fail, so it's best to handle exceptions when using it.

</Note>

## Available constants

The router provides constants for your Rhai scripts that mostly help you fetch data from the context.

```
Router.APOLLO_SDL // Context key to access the SDL
Router.APOLLO_START // Constant to calculate durations
Router.APOLLO_AUTHENTICATION_JWT_CLAIMS // Context key to access authentication jwt claims
Router.APOLLO_SUBSCRIPTION_WS_CUSTOM_CONNECTION_PARAMS // Context key to modify or access the custom connection params when using subscriptions in WebSocket to subgraphs (cf subscription docs)
Router.APOLLO_ENTITY_CACHE_KEY // Context key to access the entity cache key
Router.APOLLO_OPERATION_ID // Context key to get the value of apollo operation id (studio trace id) from the context
```

## `Request` interface

All callback functions registered via `map_request` are passed a `request` object that represents the request sent by the client. This object provides the following fields:

```
request.context
request.id
request.headers
request.method
request.body.query
request.body.operation_name
request.body.variables
request.body.extensions
request.uri.host
request.uri.path
```

<Note>

These fields are typically modifiable, apart from `method` which is always read-only. However, when the callback service is `subgraph_service`, the only modifiable field is `request.context`.

</Note>

**For `subgraph_service` callbacks only,** the `request` object provides _additional_ modifiable fields for interacting with the request that will be sent to the corresponding subgraph:

```
request.subgraph.headers
request.subgraph.body.query
request.subgraph.body.operation_name
request.subgraph.body.variables
request.subgraph.body.extensions
request.subgraph.uri.host
request.subgraph.uri.path
```

### `request.context`

The context is a generic key/value store that exists for the entire lifespan of a particular client request. You can use this to share information between multiple callbacks throughout the request's lifespan.

Keys must be strings, but values can be any Rhai object.

```rhai
// You can interact with request.context as an indexed variable
request.context["contextual"] = 42; // Adds value 42 to the context with key "contextual"
print(`${request.context["contextual"]}`); // Writes 42 to the router log at info level
// Rhai also supports extended dot notation for indexed variables, so this is equivalent
request.context.contextual = 42;
```

#### `upsert()`

The context provides an `upsert()` function for resolving situations where one of an update _or_ an insert is required when setting the value for a particular key.

To use `upsert()`, you define a callback function that receives a key's existing value (if any) and makes changes as required before returning the final value to set.

```rhai
// Get a reference to a cache-key
let my_cache_key = response.headers["cache-key"];

// Define an upsert resolver callback
// The `current` parameter is the current value for the specified key.
// This particular callback checks whether `current` is an ObjectMap 
// (default is the unit value of ()). If not, assign an empty ObjectMap.
// Finally, update the stored ObjectMap with our subgraph name as key
// and the returned cache-key as a value.
let resolver = |current| {
  if current == () {
      // No map found. Create an empty object map
      current = #{};
  }
  // Update our object map with a key and value
  current[subgraph] = my_cache_key;
  return current;
};

// Upsert our context with our resolver
response.context.upsert("surrogate-cache-key", resolver);
```

### `request.id`

The id is a string which uniquely identifies a request/response context for its entire lifespan. If you have a request (or a response) you can access the ID as follows.

```rhai
print(`request id is: ${request.id}`);
```

### `request.headers`

The headers of a request are accessible as a read/write indexed variable. The keys and values must be valid header name and value strings.

```rhai
// You can interact with request.headers as an indexed variable
request.headers["x-my-new-header"] = 42.to_string(); // Inserts a new header "x-my-new-header" with value "42"
print(`${request.headers["x-my-new-header"]}`); // Writes "42" into the router log at info level
// Rhai also supports extended dot notation for indexed variables, so this is equivalent
request.headers.x-my-new-header = 42.to_string();
// You can also set an header value from an array. Useful with the "set-cookie" header,
// Note: It's probably more useful to do this on response headers. Simply illustrating the syntax here.
request.headers["set-cookie"] = [
  "foo=bar; Domain=localhost; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 04 Jan 2023 17:25:27 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None",
  "foo2=bar2; Domain=localhost; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 04 Jan 2023 17:25:27 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None",
];
// You can also get multiple header values for a header using the values() fn
// Note: It's probably more useful to do this on response headers. Simply illustrating the syntax here.
print(`${request.headers.values("set-cookie")}`);
```

### `request.method`

This is the HTTP method of the client request.

```rhai
print(`${request.method}`); // Log the HTTP method
```

### `request.body.query`

This is the client-provided GraphQL operation string to execute.

To modify this value _before_ query planning occurs, you must do so within a `supergraph_service()` request callback. If you modify it later, the query plan is generated using the original provided operation string.

The following example modifies an incoming query and transforms it into a completely invalid query:

```rhai
print(`${request.body.query}`); // Log the query string before modification
request.body.query="query invalid { _typnam }}"; // Update the query string (in this case to an invalid query)
print(`${request.body.query}`); // Log the query string after modification
```

### `request.body.operation_name`

This is the name of the GraphQL operation to execute, if a name is provided in the request. This value _must_ be present if `request.body.query` contains more than one operation definition.

For an example of interacting with `operation_name`, see the [examples/op-name-to-header directory](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples/op-name-to-header).

```rhai
print(`${request.body.operation_name}`); // Log the operation_name before modification
request.body.operation_name +="-my-suffix"; // Append "-my-suffix" to the operation_name
print(`${request.body.operation_name}`); // Log the operation_name after modification
```

### `request.body.variables`

These are the values of any GraphQL variables provided for the operation. They are exposed to Rhai as an [Object Map](https://rhai.rs/book/language/object-maps.html).

```rhai
print(`${request.body.variables}`); // Log all GraphQL variables
```

### `request.body.extensions`

Request extensions may be read or modified. They are exposed to Rhai as an [Object Map](https://rhai.rs/book/language/object-maps.html).

```rhai
print(`${request.body.extensions}`); // Log all extensions
```

### `request.uri.host`

This is the host component of the request's URI, as a string.

Modifying this value for a client request has no effect, because the request has already reached the router. However, modifying `request.subgraph.uri.host` in a `subgraph_service` callback _does_ modify the URI that the router uses to communicate with the corresponding subgraph.

```rhai
print(`${request.uri.host}`); // Log the request host
```

### `request.uri.path`

This is the path component of the request's URI, as a string.

Modifying this value for a client request has no effect, because the request has already reached the router. However, modifying `request.subgraph.uri.path` in a `subgraph_service` callback _does_ modify the URI that the router uses to communicate with the corresponding subgraph.

```rhai
print(`${request.uri.path}`); // log the request path
request.uri.path += "/added-context"; // Add an extra element to the query path
```

### `request.subgraph.*`

The `request.subgraph` object is available _only_ for `map_request` callbacks registered in `subgraph_service`. This object has the exact same fields as `request` itself, but these fields apply to the HTTP request that the router will send to the corresponding subgraph.

```rhai
// You can interact with request.subgraph.headers as an indexed variable
request.subgraph.headers["x-my-new-header"] = 42.to_string(); // Inserts a new header "x-my-new-header" with value "42"
print(`${request.subgraph.headers["x-my-new-header"]}`); // Writes "42" into the router log at info level
// Rhai also supports extended dot notation for indexed variables, so this is equivalent
request.subgraph.headers.x-my-new-header = 42.to_string();
```

## `Response` interface

All callback functions registered via `map_response` are passed a `response` object that represents an HTTP response.

* For callbacks in `subgraph_service`, this object represents the response sent to the router by the corresponding subgraph.
* In all other services, this object represents the response that the router will send to the requesting client.

The `response` object includes the following fields:

```
response.context
response.id
response.status_code
response.headers
response.body.label
response.body.data
response.body.errors
response.body.extensions
```

All of the above fields are read/write.

The following fields are identical in behavior to their `request` counterparts:

* [`context`](#requestcontext)
* [`id`](#requestid)
* [`headers`](#requestheaders)
* [`body`](#requestbody)
* [`body.extensions`](#requestbodyextensions)

### `response.is_primary()`

Be particularly careful when interacting with headers in a response context. For router_service(), supergraph_service() and execution_service(), response headers only exist for the first response in a deferred response stream. You can handle this by making use of the `is_primary()` function which will return true if a response is the first (or primary) response. If you do try to access the headers in a non-primary response, then you'll raise an exception which can be handled like any other rhai exception, but is not so convenient as using the `is_primary()` method.

```rhai
    if response.is_primary() {
        print(`all response headers: ${response.headers}`);
    } else {
        print(`don't try to access headers`);
    }
```

Other fields are described below.

### `response.body.label`

A response may contain a label and this may be read/written as a string.

```rhai
print(`${response.body.label}`); // logs the response label
```

### `response.body.data`

A response may contain data (some responses with errors do not contain data). Be careful when manipulating data (and errors) to make sure that response remain valid. `data` is exposed to Rhai as an [Object Map](https://rhai.rs/book/language/object-maps.html).

There is a complete example of interacting with the response data in the [examples/data-response-mutate directory](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples/data-response-mutate).

```rhai
print(`${response.body.data}`); // logs the response data
```

### `response.body.errors`

A response may contain errors. Errors are represented in rhai as an array of Object Maps.

Each Error must contain at least:
 - a message (String)
 - a location (Array)

(The location can be an empty array.)

Optionally, an error may also contain extensions, which are represented as an Object Map.

There is a complete example of interacting with the response errors in the [examples/error-response-mutate directory](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples/error-response-mutate).

```rhai
// Create an error with our message
let error_to_add = #{
    message: "this is an added error",
    locations: [],
    // Extensions are optional, adding some arbitrary extensions to illustrate syntax
    extensions: #{
        field_1: "field 1",
        field_2: "field_2"
    }
};
// Add this error to any existing errors
response.body.errors += error_to_add;
print(`${response.body.errors}`); // logs the response errors
```

### `response.status_code.to_string()`

Convert response status code to a string.

```rhai
if response.status_code.to_string() == "200" {
    print(`ok`);
}
```

Also useful if you want to convert response status code to a number

```rhai
if parse_int(response.status_code.to_string()) == 200 {
    print(`ok`);
}
```

You can also create your own status code from an integer:

```rhai
if response.status_code == status_code_from_int(200) {
    print(`ok`);
}
```
