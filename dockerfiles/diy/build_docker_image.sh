###
# Build docker images from git commit hash or tag or from released version.
#
# See the usage message for more help
# docker_build_image.sh -h
#
# Requirements: To run successfully, you need quite a few utilities installed.
# Most of them are likely to be installed on your OS. Some will require
# installation, such as: docker, git, curl, mktemp, getopt
#
# Note: git is only required if you are building an image from source with the
#       -b flag.
# Note: This utility makes assumptions about the existence of files relative
#       to the directory where it is executed. To work correctly you must
#       execute in the "repo"/dockerfiles/diy directory.
# Note: A debug image is an image where heaptrack is installed. The router
#       is still a release build router, but all memory is being tracked
#       under heaptrack. (https://github.com/KDE/heaptrack)
