subtitle: Host and deploy routers in your own infrastructure
description: Distribute operations efficiently across microservices in your federated GraphQL API with the Apollo GraphOS Router or Apollo Router Core. Configure caching, security features, and more.

A self-hosted GraphOS Router or Apollo Router Core enables you to fully manage the runtime infrastructure and deployments of your supergraph.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["<b>Router</b>"]);
  serviceB[Products<br/>API];
  serviceC[Reviews<br/>API];
  router -->|Sub-query| serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.->|Query| router;
  class clients secondary;
```

<EnterpriseFeature>

Self-hosting the GraphOS Router is limited to [GraphOS Enterprise plans](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing). Other plan types use [managed cloud routing with GraphOS](/graphos/cloud-routing). Check out the [pricing page](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#graphos-router) to learn more.

## Downloading and installing a self-hosted router

Apollo provides the router as both a binary and as images to run in your containerized deployments.

### Router binary

Apollo provides a binary of the router for multiple platforms. You can download the router bundle, extract the router binary, and run it. 

To learn more, follow the steps in the [self-hosted router installation](/graphos/reference/router/self-hosted-install) reference to run a router binary with a sample supergraph schema.

### Router container image

Apollo provides container images of the router to deploy in self-hosted environments. The router images are hosted on GitHub in its container repository. Each router release includes both production and debug images. 

To learn more, go to the [Router Containerization](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization) overview.

- If running with Docker, go to the [Docker](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker) docs to learn how to run router images.
- If running with Kubernetes, go to the [Kubernetes](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/kubernetes) docs to learn to deploy with router Helm charts.

## Next steps

- To prepare your routers for production deployment, follow the guides in [Production Readiness](/graphos/schema-design/guides/production-readiness) docs.
