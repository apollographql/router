# Apollo Federation Router

Rust implementation of Federated GraphQL router.

## Getting started

Follow the [quickstart tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/quickstart/) to get up and running with the Apollo Federation Routerl.

## Status

ðŸš§ Apollo Federation Router is experimental software, not yet ready for production use.
It is not yet feature complete nor fully compliant to the GraphQL specification, we are
working on it.
It can already perform queries though, so we'd welcome experiments and feedback on it.

## Usage

Apollo Federation Router requires `configuration.yaml` and `supergraph.graphql`
to be supplied. These are either located in the current directory or explicitly
specified via flag, either by an absolute path, or a path relative to the current
directory.

```
OPTIONS:
    -c, --config <configuration-path>    Configuration file location [env:
                                         CONFIGURATION_PATH=]
    -s, --supergraph <supergraph-path>   Supergraph Schema location [env: SUPERGRAPH_PATH=]
```

This CLI is not meant to be a long term thing, as users will likely use Rover
to start the server in future.
