### Sample FTV1 by supergraph request instead of by subgraph request ([Issue #2655](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2655))

Because tracing can be costly, it is only enabled for a configurable fraction of requests. Each request is selected for tracing or not with a corresponding probability. This used to be done as part of the subgraph service, meaning that when a single supergraph request handled by the Router involves making multiple subgraph requests, it would be possible (and likely) that tracing would only be enabled for some of those sub-requests. If this same supergraph request is repeated enough times the aggregated metrics should be fine, but for smaller sample size this risks giving an unexpectedly partial view of whatâ€™s happening.

Now each supergraph request recieved by the Router is sampled or not for FTV1, and all corresponding subgraph requests reuse the same result.
