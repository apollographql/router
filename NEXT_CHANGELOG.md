## 🐛 Fixes

### Update our helm documentation to illustrate how to use our registry ([PR #1649](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1649))

The helm chart never used to have a registry, so our docs were really just placeholders. I've updated them to reflect the fact that we now store the chart in our OCI registry.

## 🛠 Maintenance

### Refactor `SupergraphService` ([PR #1615](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1615))

The `SupergrapHService` code became too complex, so much that `rsutfmt` could not modify it anymore.
This breaks up the code in more manageable functions.
