# JWT authentication

DISCLAIMER: This is an example for illustrative purposes. It has not been security audited and is purely intended as an 
illustration of an approach to JWT verification via a router plugin.

Demonstrates using `checkpoint` to perform authentication and reject requests that do not pass auth.

## Usage
```bash
cargo run -- -s ../graphql/supergraph.graphql -c ./router.yaml
```

## Implementation

`checkpoint` and `checkpoint_async` allow you to halt request and return immediately. This is particularly useful for authentication.

```rust
    fn supergraph_service(
        &mut self,
        service: router::BoxService,
    ) -> router::BoxService {
        ServiceBuilder::new()
            .checkpoint(...) // Validation happens here
            .service(service)
            .boxed()
    }
```
