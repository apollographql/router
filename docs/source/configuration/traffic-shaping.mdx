title: Traffic shaping in the Apollo Router
---

The Apollo Router supports the following types of traffic shaping between itself and your subgraphs:

- **Sub-query deduplication** - Whenever the router is sending multiple identical in-flight query operations to a subgraph, it can consolidate them into a single request.
  - Mutation operations are never deduplicated.
  - Only in-flight requests are deduplicated.
- **Variable deduplication** - If a request to a subgraph includes multiple GraphQL variables with the same value, the router can replace those with a single variable.
- **Compression** - The router can compress request bodies to subgraphs (along with response bodies to clients) with a supported algorithm
  - The router currently supports `gzip`, `br`, and `deflate`.
- **Rate limiting** - If you want to rate limit requests to a subgraphs or to the router itself.
- **Timeout**: - Set a timeout to subgraphs and router requests.

Each of these optimizations can reduce network bandwidth and CPU usage for your subgraphs.

## Configuration

To enable traffic shaping, add the `traffic_shaping` plugin to your [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file), like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
traffic_shaping:
  variables_deduplication: true # Enable the variable deduplication optimization.
  router: # Rules applied to the router requests
    rate_limit: # Only accept 10 requests per 5 secs maximum. If it reaches the limit, requests are rejected
      num: 10
      per: 5sec
    timeout: 50sec # If request to the router hangs for more than 50secs then cancel the request (by default it's 30 secs)
  all:
    query_deduplication: true # Enable query deduplication for all subgraphs.
    compression: br # Enable brotli compression for all subgraphs.
  subgraphs:
    products:
      query_deduplication: false # Disable query for the products subgraph.
      compression: gzip # Enable gzip compression only for the products subgraph.
      rate_limit: # Only accept 10 requests per 5 secs maximum. If it reaches the limit, requests are rejected
        num: 10
        per: 5sec
      timeout: 50sec # If request to subgraph product hangs for more than 50secs then cancel the request (by default it's 30 secs)
```

Any configuration under the `subgraphs` key takes precedence over configuration under the `all` key. In the example above, query deduplication is enabled for all subgraphs _except_ the `products` subgraph.
