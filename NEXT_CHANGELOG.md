# [1.8.0] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## 🚀 Features

### Add support for single instance Redis ([Issue #2300](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2300))

For `experimental_cache` with redis caching it now works with only a single Redis instance if you provide only one URL.

### Apollo Router landing page ([PR #2282](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2282))

We've added a `graph_ref` option to the `homepage` configuration, this will allow you to redirect from the Apollo Router landing page back to Apollo Studio Explorer.  The experience now duplicates the user-experience which exists in Apollo Gateway today.
