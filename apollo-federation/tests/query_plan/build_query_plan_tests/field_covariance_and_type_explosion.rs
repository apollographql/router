//! This tests the issue from https://github.com/apollographql/federation/issues/1858.
//! That issue, which was a bug in the handling of selection sets, was concretely triggered with
//! a mix of an interface field implemented with some covariance and the query plan using
//! type-explosion.
//! We include a test using a federation 1 supergraph as this is how the issue was discovered
//! and it is the simplest way to reproduce since type-explosion is always triggered when we
//! have federation 1 supergraph (due to those lacking information on interfaces). The 2nd
//! test shows that error can be reproduced on a pure fed2 example, it's just a bit more
//! complex as we need to involve a @provide just to force the query planner to type explode
//! (more precisely, this force the query planner to _consider_ type explosion; the generated
//! query plan still ends up not type-exploding in practice since as it's not necessary).
