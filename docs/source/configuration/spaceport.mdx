## Usage reporting agent (spaceport)

**Spaceport** is a reporting agent for the Apollo Router that can transmit usage data to Apollo Studio. By default, it runs automatically as a component _within_ the Apollo Router. Additional details on its modes of operation are provided below.

> **Note:** As with the rest of the Apollo Router, spaceport is in active development. Its behavior and functionality might change before general availability release. We welcome user feedback both during and after this alpha period.

### Enabling usage reporting

You enable usage reporting in the Apollo Router by following the same steps listed in [Connecting to Apollo Uplink](#connecting-to-apollo-uplink).

More information on usage reporting is available in the [Studio documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/metrics/usage-reporting/).

### Configuring Spaceport

Spaceport can run either as an [internal component](#internal-spaceport) of a single Apollo Router instance, or as an [external resource](#external-spaceport) shared by _multiple_ router instances.

```yaml title="config.router.yaml"
telemetry:
  # Spaceport configuration. These values are the default values if not specified
  spaceport:
    # By default, Apollo Router runs an internal collector. You can override
    # this default behavior by setting `external: true`. If `true`, no reporting
    # agent spawns, and the router instead communicates with `collector` below.
    external: false

    # If `external` is `true`, this should be the location of a spaceport
    # that's running external from the Router. Omit otherwise.
    collector: https://127.0.0.1:50051

    # If `external` is `false`, this is the interface and port to listen on.
    # Omit otherwise.
    listener: 127.0.0.1:50051
```

#### Internal spaceport

By default, spaceport runs within a single Apollo Router instance. This default is recommended for most cases, including in production environments. It requires no additional configuration beyond the setup in [Connecting to Apollo Uplink](#connecting-to-apollo-uplink).

You can configure which address the internal spaceport listens on by setting the `listener` property [shown above](#configuring-spaceport). This should only be necessary if there's a conflict on the default port that Router chooses (e.g., if running multiple routers or other applications using the same port on the same host), or if it's desirable to change the bind address.

#### External spaceport

Running an external spaceport _is not necessary in most cases_. It might be desirable in certain production environments where configuration of sensitive key data or allocation of reporting resources needs to be operated centrally.  Under heavier workloads, it can also be beneficial to externalize the trace processing to reduce the amount of work that individiual router instances take on. The `listener` parameter is ignored for an external spaceport.

To enable the external spaceport, another Router can be run to act as the collector with the _exclusive_ role of processing Studio data. To configure this, the "collector" should have `external` set to `false` and an appropriate `listener` address and port combination. Routers exporting Studio data should set `external` to `true`, omit `listener`, and configure the `collector` property to point to the collector router.
