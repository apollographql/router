### Remove cache layer ([PR #1647](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1647))

We removed ServiceBuilderExt::cache in 0.16.0. That was the only consumer of
the cache layer. This completes the removal by deleting the cache layer.

### Refactor `SupergraphService` ([PR #1615](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1615))

The `SupergrapHService` code became too complex, so much that `rsutfmt` could not modify it anymore.
This breaks up the code in more manageable functions.
