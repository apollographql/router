# [v0.1.0-prealpha.4] 2021-11-05

## :rocket: Features

- **An updated `CHANGELOG.md`!**

  As we build out the base functionality for the router, we haven't spent much time updating the `CHANGELOG`.  We should probably get better at that!

## :bug: Fixes

- **Potentially, many!**

  But the lack of clarity goes back to not having kept track of everything thus far!  We can _fix_ our processes to keep track of these things! :smile_cat:

# [0.1.0] - TBA
