title: Sending Apollo Router usage data to Apollo Studio
---

The Apollo Router can transmit usage data to Apollo Studio via a reporting agent called **Spaceport**. By default, Spaceport runs automatically as a component _within_ the Apollo Router. Additional details on its modes of operation are provided below.

## Enabling usage reporting

You can enable usage reporting in the Apollo Router by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
export APOLLO_KEY=<YOUR_GRAPH_API_KEY>
export APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=<YOUR_GRAPH_ID>@<VARIANT>
```

More information on usage reporting is available in the [Studio documentation](/studio/metrics/usage-reporting/).

## Advanced configuration (not recommended)

Spaceport can run either as an internal component of a single Apollo Router instance, or as an external resource shared by _multiple_ router instances.

For the majority of users, an internal Spaceport instance is sufficient.

To connect the Apollo Router to an external Spaceport instance, specify its endpoint URL in your YAML config file:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
    apollo:
        # The percentage of requests will include HTTP request and response headers in traces sent to Apollo Studio.
        # This is expensive and should be left at a low value.
        # This cannot be higher than tracing->trace_config->sampler
        field_level_instrumentation_sampler: 0.01 # (default)
        
        # Include HTTP request and response headers in traces sent to Apollo Studio
        send_headers: # other possible values are all, only (with an array), except (with an array), none (by default)
            except: # Send all headers except referer
            - referer

        # Include variable values in Apollo in traces sent to Apollo Studio
        send_variable_values: # other possible values are all, only (with an array), except (with an array), none (by default)
            except: # Send all variable values except for variable named first
            - first
    tracing:
        trace_config:
            sampler: 0.5 # The percentage of requests that will generate traces (a rate or `always_on` or `always_off`)
```

Note that `field_level_instrumentation_sampler` may not sample at a greater rate than `trace_config/sampler`.****

## Running Spaceport externally (not recommended)

Running spaceport as a separate process currently requires building from [source](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/apollo-spaceport).
