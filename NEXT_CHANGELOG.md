## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó
## üöÄ Features

### Support serviceMonitor in helm chart

`kube-prometheus-stack` ignores scrape annotations, so a `serviceMonitor` CRD is required to scrape a given target to avoid scrape_configs. 

By [@hobbsh](https://github.com/hobbsh) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1853

### Add support of dynamic header injection ([Issue #1755](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1755))

+ Insert static header

```yaml
headers:
  all: # Header rules for all subgraphs
    request:
    - insert:
        name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router"
        value: "indeed"
```

+ Insert header from context

```yaml
headers:
  all: # Header rules for all subgraphs
    request:
    - insert:
        name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router-context"
        from_context: "my_key_in_context"
```

+ Insert header from request body

```yaml
headers:
  all: # Header rules for all subgraphs
    request:
    + insert:
        name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router-request-body"
        path: ".operationName" # It's a JSON path query to fetch the operation name from request body
        default: "UNKNOWN" # If no operationName has been specified
```

## üêõ Fixes

### Do not erase errors when missing `_entities` ([Issue #1863](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1863))

in a federated query, if the subgraph returned a response with errors and a null or absent data field, the router
was ignoring the subgraph error and instead returning an error complaining about the missing` _entities` field.
This will now aggregate the subgraph error and the missing `_entities` error.

### Fix prometheus annotation and healthcheck default

The prometheus annotation is breaking on a `helm upgrade` so this fixes the template and also sets defaults. Additionally
defaults are set for `health-check` listen to `0.0.0.0:8088` in the helm chart.

By [@hobbsh](https://github.com/hobbsh) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1883

### Move response formatting to the execution service ([PR #1771](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1771))

The response formatting process, where response data is filtered according to deferred responses subselections
and the API schema, was executed in the supergraph service. This is a bit late, because it results in the
execution service returning a stream of invalid responses, so the execution plugins work on invalid data.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Change span attribute names in otel to be more consistent ([PR #1876](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1876))

Change span attributes name in our tracing to be more consistent and use namespaced attributes to be compliant with opentelemetry specs.

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1876

### Have CI use rust-toolchain.toml and not install another redudant toolchain ([Issue #1313](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1313))

Avoids redundant work in CI and makes the YAML configuration less mis-leading.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1877

### Query plan execution refactoring ([PR #1843](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1843))

This splits the query plan execution in multiple modules to make the code more manageable.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1843

### Remove `Buffer` from APQ ([PR #1641](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1641))

This removes `tower::Buffer` usage from the Automated Persisted Queries implementation to improve reliability.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1641

### Remove `Buffer` from query deduplication ([PR #1889](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1889))

This removes `tower::Buffer` usage from the query deduplication implementation to improve reliability.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1889

### Set MSRV to 1.63.0 ([PR #1886](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1886))

We compile and test with 1.63.0 on CI at the moment,
so it is our de-facto minimum supported rust version.
Setting [`rust-version`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-rust-version-field)
in `Cargo.toml` provides a more helpful error message when using an older version
that random compilation errors.
