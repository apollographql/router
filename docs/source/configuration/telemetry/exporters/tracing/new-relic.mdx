Enable and configure the [OTLP exporter](./otlp) for tracing in the Apollo Router for use with [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/).

For general tracing configuration, refer to [Router Tracing Configuration](./overview).

## New Relic configuration

To configure the router, enable the [OTLP exporter](./otlp/#otlp-configuration) and set both `endpoint: <new-relic-endpoint>` and `api-key: <new-relic-api-key>`. For example: 

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    tracing:
      otlp:
        enabled: true
        # Endpoint for your region.
        endpoint: <new-relic-endpoint>
        protocol: grpc
        grpc:
          metadata:
            "api-key":
              - <new-relic-api-key>

```
