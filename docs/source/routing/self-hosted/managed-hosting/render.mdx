In this guide, you will deploy the GraphOS Router using the [Render](https://render.com/) template.

## Prerequisites

You will need:

- [A GraphQL API set up in GraphOS](/graphos/get-started/guides/graphql#step-1-set-up-your-graphql-api). You will need your graph credentials: `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`.
- A [Render account](https://render.com/)
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)

## Steps

The fastest way to deploy the Apollo Router on Render is using the official template:

1. Deploy using the template:
    <a href="https://render.com/deploy?repo=github.com/apollographql/router-template" hideExternalIcon className="inline-block">
      <img src="https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg" alt="Deploy to Render" width="200px" noZoom />
    </a>

1. Configure your service:
   - **Service Name**: Enter a name for your router service
   - **Branch**: Select `main` or your preferred branch

1. Set environment variables:
   - `APOLLO_KEY`: Your Graph API key from GraphOS Studio
   - `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`: Your graph reference, e.g. `my-graph@production`
   - `PORT`: Set to `4000`

1. Click **Create Web Service** to start the deployment.

1. After the deployment finishes, visit your service URL to confirm the router is running.
