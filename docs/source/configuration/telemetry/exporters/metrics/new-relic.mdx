subtitle: Configure the New Relic exporter for metrics
description: Configure the New Relic exporter for metrics via OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) in the Apollo GraphOS Router or Apollo Router Core.
---

Enable and configure the [OTLP exporter](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/metrics/otlp) for metrics in the GraphOS Router or Apollo Router Core for use with [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/).

For general tracing configuration, refer to [Router Metrics Configuration](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/metrics/overview).

## New Relic configuration

To configure the router, enable the [OTLP exporter](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/metrics/otlp#configuration) and set `temporality: delta`, `endpoint: <new-relic-endpoint>` and `api-key: <new-relic-api-key>`. For example: 

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    metrics:
      otlp:
        enabled: true
        # Temporality MUST be set to delta. Failure to do this will result in incorrect metrics.
        temporality: delta
        # Endpoint for your region.
        endpoint: <new-relic-endpoint>
        protocol: grpc
        grpc:
          metadata:
            "api-key":
              - <new-relic-api-key>

```

<Note>

**You must set `temporality: delta`**, otherwise metrics will not be visible in New Relic.
