# [0.9.4] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó
### The `apollo-router-core` crate has been merged into `apollo-router`

To upgrade, remove any dependency on the former in `Cargo.toml` files (keeping only the latter), and change imports like so:

```diff
- use apollo_router_core::prelude::*;
+ use apollo_router::prelude::*;
```

## üöÄ Features
### Add more customizable metrics ([PR #1159](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1159))
Added the ability to add custom attributes/labels on metrics via the configuration file.
Example:
```yaml
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      attributes:
        static:
          - name: "version"
            value: "v1.0.0"
        from_headers:
          - named: "content-type"
            rename: "payload_type"
            default: "application/json"
          - named: "x-custom-header-to-add"
```

### Allow to set a custom health check path ([PR #1164](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1164))
Added the possibility to set a custom health check path
```yaml
server:
  # Default is /.well-known/apollo/server-health
  health_check_path: /health
```
