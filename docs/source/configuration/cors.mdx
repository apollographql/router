By default, the Apollo Router enables _only_ Apollo Studio to initiate browser connections to it. If your supergraph serves data to other browser-based applications, you need to do one of the following in the `server.cors` section of your router's [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file):

* Add the origins of those web applications to the router's list of allowed `origins`.
    * Use this option if there is a known, finite list of web applications that consume your supergraph.
    * You _must_ use this option if clients need to [authenticate their requests with cookies](#passing-credentials-with-cors).
* Enable the `allow_any_origin` option.
    * Use this option if your supergraph is a public API with arbitrarily many web app consumers.
    * With this option enabled, the router sends the [wildcard (`*`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin#directives) value for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. This enables _any_ website to initiate browser connections to it (but they can't provide cookies or other credentials).

The following snippet includes an example of each option (use only one):

```yaml title="router.yaml"
server:
  cors:

    # Set to true to allow any origin
    # (Defaults to false)
    allow_any_origin: true

    # List of accepted origins
    # (Ignored if allow_any_origin is true)
    # (Defaults to the Apollo Studio url: `https://studio.apollographql.com`)
    origins:
      - https://www.your-app.example.com/
      - https://studio.apollographql.com/ # Keep this so Apollo Studio can run queries against your router
```

You can also disable CORS entirely by setting `origins` to an empty list:

```yml title="router.yaml"
server:
  cors:
    origins: []
```

> If your router serves exclusively _non_-browser-based clients, you probably don't need to modify the default CORS configuration.

## Passing credentials

If your router requires requests to [include a user's credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#requests_with_credentials) (e.g., via cookies), you need to modify your CORS configuration to tell the browser those credentials are allowed.

You can enable credentials with CORS by setting the [`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials) HTTP header to `true`.

> **Your router's config file must specify individual `origins` to support credentialed requests.** If your router enables `allow_any_origin`, your browser will refuse to send credentials.

To allow browsers to pass credentials to the Apollo Router, set `allow_credentials` to `true`, like so:

```yaml {6} title="router.yaml"
server:
  cors:
    origins:
      - https://www.your-app.example.com/
      - https://studio.apollographql.com/
    allow_credentials: true
```

For examples of sending cookies and authorization headers from Apollo Client, see [Authentication](/react/networking/authentication/).


## All `cors` options

The following snippet shows all CORS configuration for the Apollo Router:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
server:
  #
  # CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
  #
  cors:

    # Set to true to allow any origin
    # (Defaults to false)
    allow_any_origin: true

    # List of accepted origins
    # (Ignored if allow_any_origin is true)
    # (Defaults to the Apollo Studio url: `https://studio.apollographql.com`)
    origins:
      - https://www.your-app.example.com/
      - https://studio.apollographql.com/ # Keep this so Apollo Studio can still run queries against your router

    # Set to true to add the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header
    # (Defaults to false)
    allow_credentials: true

    # The headers to allow.
    # If this field is not set, CORS will default to the `mirror_request` mode,
    # which mirrors the received `access-control-request-headers`
    # (This is equivalent to allowing any headers)
    allow_headers: [ Content-Type, Authorization, x-my-custom-required-header, x-and-an-other-required-header ]

    # Allowed request methods
    # (Defaults to [ GET, POST, OPTIONS ])
    methods: [ POST, OPTIONS ]

    # Which response headers are available to scripts running in the
    # browser in response to a cross-origin request.
    # (Defaults to empty array)
    expose_headers: []
```
