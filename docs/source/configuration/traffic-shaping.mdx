> ⚠️ Apollo Router support for traffic shaping is currently experimental.

The Apollo Router provides experimental support for traffic shaping.

Currently features are limited, but are expected to grow over time:

* **Sub-query deduplication** - Identical, in-flight, non-mutation sub-queries are compressed into a single request.

## Configuration
To configure traffic shaping add the `traffic_shaping` plugin to `your router.yaml`:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
plugins:
  experimental.traffic_shaping:
    all:
      dedup: true # Enable dedup for all subgraphs.
    subgraphs: 
      products:
        dedup: false # Disable dedup for products.
```

Note that configuration in the `subgraphs` section will take precedence over that in the `all` section.

### Sub-query deduplication

Deduplication will cause any identical, in-flight, non-mutation sub-queries to be merged into a single request. This can reduce network bandwidth and CPU at your subgraph.

Note that only in flight requests are deduplicated.
