/// An immutable path in a query graph.
///
/// A "path" here is mostly understood in the graph-theoretical sense of the term, i.e. as "a
/// connected series of edges"; a `GraphPath` is generated by traversing a query graph.
///
/// However, as query graph edges may have conditions, a `GraphPath` also records, for each edge it
/// is composed of, the set of paths (an `OpPathTree` in practice) that were taken to fulfill each
/// edge's conditions (when an edge has one).
///
/// Additionally, for each edge of the path, a `GraphPath` records the "trigger" that made the
/// traversal take that edge. In practice, the "trigger" can be seen as a way to decorate a path
/// with some additional metadata for each element of the path. In practice, that trigger is used in
/// 2 main ways (corresponding to our 2 main query graph traversals):
/// - For composition validation, the traversal of the federated query graph is driven by other
///   transitions into the supergraph API query graph (essentially, composition validation is about
///   finding, for every path in supergraph API query graph, a "matching" traversal of the federated
///   query graph). In that case, for the graph paths we build on the federated query graph, the
///   "trigger" will be one of the edge transitions from the supergraph API query graph (which,
///   granted, will be fairly similar to the one of the edge we're taking in the federated query
///   graph; in practice, triggers are more useful in the query planning case).
/// - For query planning, the traversal of the federated query graph is driven by the elements of
///   the query we are planning. Which means that the "trigger" for taking an edge in this case will
///   be an operation element (or `None`). See the specialized `OpGraphPath` that is defined for this
///   use case.
///
/// Lastly, some `GraphPath`s can actually encode `None` edges: this is used during query planning
/// in the (rare) case where the query we plan for has an inline fragment spread without type
/// condition (or a "useless" one, i.e. one that doesn't restrict the possible types anymore than
/// they already were) but with some directives. In that case, we want to preserve the information
/// about the directive (to properly rebuild query plans later) but it doesn't correspond to taking
/// any edges, so we add a `None` edge and use the trigger to store the fragment spread.
///
/// Regarding type parameters:
/// - `TTrigger`: The type of the path's "triggers", metadata that can associated to each element
///   of the path (see above for more details).
/// - `TEdge`: The type of the edge. Either `Option<EdgeIndex>` (meaning that the path may have a
///   `None` edge) or `never` (the path cannot have `None` edges).
// PORT_NOTE: The JS codebase also parameterized whether the head of the path was a root node, but
// in the Rust code we don't have a distinguished type for that case. We instead check this at
// runtime (at the callsites that require root nodes). This means the `RootPath` type in the
// JS codebase is replaced with this one.
