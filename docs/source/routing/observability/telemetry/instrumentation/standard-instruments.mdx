## Standard metric instruments

GraphOS Router and Apollo Router Core provide a set of standard router instruments that expose detailed information about the router's request lifecycle. You can consume the metrics they capture by configuring a [metrics exporter](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/metrics/overview).

Standard router instruments are different than OpenTelemetry (OTel) instruments or custom instruments:

- Router instruments provide standard metrics about the router request lifeycle and have names starting with `apollo.router` or `apollo_router`.
- OTel instruments provide metrics about the HTTP lifecycle and have names starting with `http`.
- Custom instruments provide customized metrics about the router request lifecycle.

The rest of this reference lists the available standard router instruments.

### GraphQL

- `apollo.router.graphql_error` - counts GraphQL errors in responses. Also counts errors which occur during the response validation phase, which are represented in client responses as `extensions.valueCompletion` instead of actual GraphQL errors. Attributes:
  - `code`: error code, including `RESPONSE_VALIDATION_FAILED` in the case of a value completion error.

### Session

- `apollo.router.session.count.active` - Number of in-flight GraphQL requests

### Cache

- `apollo.router.cache.size` â€” Number of entries in the cache
- `apollo.router.cache.hit.time` - Time to hit the cache in seconds
- `apollo.router.cache.hit.time.count` - Number of cache hits
- `apollo.router.cache.miss.time` - Time to miss the cache in seconds
- `apollo.router.cache.miss.time.count` - Number of cache misses
- `apollo.router.cache.storage.estimated_size` - The estimated storage size of the cache in bytes (query planner in memory only).

All cache metrics listed above have the following attributes:

- `kind`: the cache being queried (`apq`, `query planner`, `introspection`)
- `storage`: The backend storage of the cache (`memory`, `redis`)

### Coprocessor

- `apollo.router.operations.coprocessor` - Total operations with coprocessors enabled.
  - `coprocessor.succeeded`: bool
  - `coprocessor.stage`: string (`RouterRequest`, `RouterResponse`, `SubgraphRequest`, `SubgraphResponse`)

- `apollo.router.operations.coprocessor.duration` - Time spent waiting for the coprocessor to answer, in seconds.
  - `coprocessor.stage`: string (`RouterRequest`, `RouterResponse`, `SubgraphRequest`, `SubgraphResponse`)

### Performance

- `apollo_router_schema_load_duration` - Time spent loading the schema in seconds.

### Query planning

- `apollo.router.query_planning.warmup.duration` - Time spent warming up the query planner queries in seconds.
- `apollo.router.query_planning.plan.duration` - Histogram of plan durations isolated to query planning time only.
- `apollo.router.query_planning.total.duration` - Histogram of plan durations including queue time.
- `apollo.router.query_planning.plan.evaluated_plans` - Histogram of the number of evaluated query plans.

### Compute jobs

- `apollo.router.compute_jobs.queued` - A gauge of the number of jobs queued for the thread pool dedicated to CPU-heavy components like GraphQL parsing and validation, and the query planner.
- `apollo.router.compute_jobs.queue_is_full` - A counter of requests rejected because the queue was full.
- `apollo.router.compute_jobs.duration` - A histogram of time spent in the compute pipeline by the job, including the queue and query planning.
  - `job.type`: (`QueryPlanning`, `QueryParsing`, `Introspection`)
  - `job.outcome`: (`ExecutedOk`, `ExecutedError`, `ChannelError`, `RejectedQueueFull`, `Abandoned`)
- `apollo.router.compute_jobs.queue.wait.duration` - A histogram of time spent in the compute queue by the job.
  - `job.type`: (`QueryPlanning`, `QueryParsing`, `Introspection`)
- `apollo.router.compute_jobs.execution.duration` - A histogram of time spent to execute job (excludes time spent in the queue).
  - `job.type`: (`QueryPlanning`, `QueryParsing`, `Introspection`)
- `apollo.router.compute_jobs.active_jobs` - A gauge of the number of compute jobs being processed in parallel.
  - `job.type`: (`QueryPlanning`, `QueryParsing`, `Introspection`)
### Uplink

<Tip>

[Learn more about Apollo Uplink.](/federation/managed-federation/uplink/)

</Tip>

- `apollo_router_uplink_fetch_duration_seconds` - Uplink request duration, attributes:
  - `url`: The Uplink URL that was polled
  - `query`: The query that the router sent to Uplink (`SupergraphSdl` or `License`)
  - `kind`: (`new`, `unchanged`, `http_error`, `uplink_error`)
  - `code`: The error code depending on type (if an error occurred)
  - `error`: The error message (if an error occurred)
- `apollo_router_uplink_fetch_count_total`
  - `status`: (`success`, `failure`)
  - `query`: The query that the router sent to Uplink (`SupergraphSdl` or `License`)

<Note>

The initial call to Uplink during router startup is not reflected in metrics.

### Subscriptions

<Tip>

[Learn more about subscriptions.](/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/)

</Tip>

- `apollo.router.opened.subscriptions` - Number of different opened subscriptions (not the number of clients with an opened subscriptions in case it's deduplicated). This metric contains `graphql.operation.name` label to know exactly which subscription is still opened.
- `apollo.router.skipped.event.count` - Number of subscription events that has been skipped because too many events have been received from the subgraph but not yet sent to the client.

### Batching

- `apollo.router.operations.batching` - A counter of the number of query batches received by the router.
- `apollo.router.operations.batching.size` - A histogram tracking the number of queries contained within a query batch.

### GraphOS Studio

- `apollo.router.telemetry.studio.reports` - The number of reports submitted to GraphOS Studio by the router.
  - `report.type`: The type of report submitted: "traces" or "metrics"
  - `report.protocol`: Either "apollo" or "otlp", depending on the otlp_tracing_sampler configuration.

### Telemetry

- `apollo.router.telemetry.batch_processor.errors` - The number of errors encountered by exporter batch processors.
  - `name`: One of `apollo-tracing`, `datadog-tracing`, `jaeger-collector`, `otlp-tracing`, `zipkin-tracing`.
  - `error`: One of `channel closed`, `channel full`.

- `apollo.router.telemetry.metrics.cardinality_overflow` - A count of how often a telemetry metric hit otel's hard cardinality limit.

### Internals

- `apollo.router.pipelines` - The number of request pipelines active in the router
  - `schema.id` - The Apollo Studio schema hash associated with the pipeline.
  - `launch.id` - The Apollo Studio launch id associated with the pipeline (optional).
  - `config.hash` - The hash of the configuration

### Server

- `apollo.router.open_connections` - The number of open connections to the Router.
  - `schema.id` - The Apollo Studio schema hash associated with the pipeline.
  - `launch.id` - The Apollo Studio launch id associated with the pipeline (optional).
  - `config.hash` - The hash of the configuration.
  - `server.address` - The address that the router is listening on.
  - `server.port` - The port that the router is listening on if not a unix socket.
  - `http.connection.state` - Either `active` or `terminating`.
