title: Federation version support in the Apollo Router
---

import { Link } from 'gatsby';

The Apollo Router uses Federation 2.x. However, Federation 2.x
is [backward compatible with Federation 1.x](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federation-2/backward-compatibility/)
.

As long as your graph is valid then your Federation 1 graph will work.

Apollo Federation is an evolving project, and it will receive new features and bug fixes over time. If you need to run a
particular version of Federation then the following table shows the version that the Router releases are compiled
against.

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Router version</th>
        <th>Federation version</th>
        <th>Release date</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>v0.1.0-preview.6
        </td>
        <td>
            2.0.1
        </td>
        <td>

If your Federation 1.x graph is not working with the Router, then please check
the [backward compatibility with Federation 1.x](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federation-2/backward-compatibility/)
notes to see if there is an issue with your graph.
