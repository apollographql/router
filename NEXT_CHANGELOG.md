## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó
## üöÄ Features

### Add support for dhat based heap profiling ([PR #1829](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1829))

[dhat-rs](https://github.com/nnethercote/dhat-rs) provides [DHAT](https://www.valgrind.org/docs/manual/dh-manual.html) style heap profiling. We have added two compile features, dhat-heap and dhat-ad-hoc, which leverage this ability.

### Add `trace_id` in logs to identify all logs related to a specific request ([Issue #1981](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1981))

It automatically adds a `trace_id` on logs to identify which log is related to a specific request. Also adds `apollo_trace_id` in response headers to help the client to identify logs for this request.

Example of logs in text:

```logs
2022-10-21T15:17:45.562553Z ERROR [trace_id=5e6a6bda8d0dca26e5aec14dafa6d96f] apollo_router::services::subgraph_service: fetch_error="hyper::Error(Connect, ConnectError(\"tcp connect error\", Os { code: 111, kind: ConnectionRefused, message: \"Connection refused\" }))"
2022-10-21T15:17:45.565768Z ERROR [trace_id=5e6a6bda8d0dca26e5aec14dafa6d96f] apollo_router::query_planner::execution: Fetch error: HTTP fetch failed from 'accounts': HTTP fetch failed from 'accounts': error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 111)
```

Example of logs in JSON:

```logs
{"timestamp":"2022-10-26T15:39:01.078260Z","level":"ERROR","fetch_error":"hyper::Error(Connect, ConnectError(\"tcp connect error\", Os { code: 111, kind: ConnectionRefused, message: \"Connection refused\" }))","target":"apollo_router::services::subgraph_service","filename":"apollo-router/src/services/subgraph_service.rs","line_number":182,"span":{"name":"subgraph"},"spans":[{"trace_id":"5e6a6bda8d0dca26e5aec14dafa6d96f","name":"request"},{"name":"supergraph"},{"name":"execution"},{"name":"parallel"},{"name":"fetch"},{"name":"subgraph"}]}

### Reload the configuration when receiving the SIGHUP signal ([Issue #35](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/35))

This adds support for reloading configuration when receiving the SIGHUP signal. This only works on unix-like platforms,
and only with the configuration file.

## üêõ Fixes

### Fix the deduplication logic in deduplication caching ([Issue #1984](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1984))

Under load, it is possible to break the router deduplication logic and leave orphaned entries in the waiter map. This fixes the logic to prevent this from occurring.

### Follow directives from Uplink ([Issue #1494](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1494) [Issue #1539](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1539))

The Uplink API returns actionable info in its responses:
- some error codes indicate an unrecoverable issue, for which the router should not retry the query (example: non-existing graph)
- it can tell the router when it should retry the query

### Fix the rhai SDL print function ([Issue #2005](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2005))

A recent change to the way we provide the SDL to plugins broke the rhai SDL print. This fixes it.

### Exports a missing strut (`router_factory::Endpoint`) that was preventing the `web_endpoints` trait from being implemented by Plugins

### Validate default values for input object fields ([Issue #1979](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1979))

When validating variables, we should use default values for object fields if applicable.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Apply tower best practice to inner service cloning ([PR #2030](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2030))

Our service readiness checking can be improved by following tower project recommendations for cloning inner services.

### Split the configuration file management in multiple modules ([Issue #1790](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1790))

The file is becoming large and hard to modify.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1996

## üìö Documentation

### Remove references to git submodules from DEVELOPMENT.md ([Issue #2012](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2012))

We don't need instructions about submodules since #1856. Let's remove them.
