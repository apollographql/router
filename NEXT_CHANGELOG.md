## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Removed `Request::from_bytes()` from public API ([Issue #1855](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1855))

We've removed `Request::from_bytes()` from the public API.  We were no longer using it internally and we hardly expect anyone external to have been relying on it so it was worth the remaining breaking change prior to v1.0.0.

We discovered this function during an exercise of documenting our entire public API.  While we considered keeping it, it didn't necessarily meet our requirements for shipping it in the public API.  It's internal usage was removed in [`d147f97d`](https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/d147f97d as part of [PR #429](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/429).

We're happy to consider re-introducing this in the future (it even has a matching `Response::from_bytes()` which it composes against nicely!), but we thought it was best to remove it for the time-being.

### Update and validate configuration files ([Issue #1854](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1854))

Several of the `Dockerfile`s in the repository were out-of-date with respect to recent configuration changes.  We've updated the configuration files and extended our tests to catch this automatically in the future.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Disable Deno snapshotting when building inside `docs.rs`

This works around [V8 linking errors](https://docs.rs/crate/apollo-router/1.0.0-rc.2/builds/633287) and caters to specific build-environment constraints and requirements that exist on the Rust documentation site `docs.rs`.

### Add the Studio Uplink schema to the repository, with a test checking that it is up to date.

Previously we were downloading the Apollo Studio Uplink schema (which is used for fetching Managed Federation schema updates) at compile-time, which would [fail](https://docs.rs/crate/lets-see-if-this-builds-on-docs-rs/0.0.1/builds/633305) in build environments without Internet access, like `docs.rs`' build system.

If an update is needed, the test failure will print a message with the command to run.
