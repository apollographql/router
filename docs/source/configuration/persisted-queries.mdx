## Differences from automatic persisted queries

The Apollo Router also supports a related feature called [automatic persisted queries](./in-memory-caching#caching-automatic-persisted-queries-apq) (APQ). With APQ, clients can execute a GraphQL operation by sending the SHA256 hash of its operation string instead of the entire string. **APQ doesn't support safelisting** because the router updates its APQ cache over time with _any_ operations it receives.

For more details on differences between APQ and this feature, see the [GraphOS persisted queries documentation](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries#differences-from-automatic-persisted-queries).

## Implementation

Enabling operation safelisting has a few steps:

1. PQL creation and linking
1. Router configuration
1. Operation registration
1. Client updates

This article details the router configuration step.
For more information on other configuration aspects, see the [GraphOS persisted queries documentation](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries).

## Router configuration

<PQRouterConfiguration />

### Router security levels

<PQSecurityLevels />

### Configuration options

The router provides four configuration options that you can combine to create the recommended [security levels](#router-security-levels). This section details each configuration option. Refer to the [security levels](#router-security-levels) section for recommended combinations.

<Note>

From version `1.25.0` to `1.32.0`, the `persisted_queries` configuration option was named `preview_persisted_queries`. Upgrade your router to version `1.32.0` or later to use the [generally available](/resources/product-launch-stages/#general-availability) version of the feature and the example configuration snippets below.

</Note>

#### `persisted_queries`

This base configuration enables the feature. All other configuration options build off this one.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
persisted_queries:
  enabled: true
```

#### `log_unknown`

Adding `log_unknown: true` to `persisted_queries` configures the router to log any incoming operations not registered to the PQL.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
persisted_queries:
  enabled: true
  log_unknown: true
```

If used with the [`safelist`](#safelist) option, the router logs unregistered and rejected operations. With [`safelist.required_id`](#require_id) off, the only rejected operations are unregistered ones. If [`safelist.required_id`](#require_id) is turned on, operations can be rejected even when registered because they use operation IDs rather than operation strings.

#### `experimental_prewarm_query_plan_cache`

<ExperimentalFeature />

Adding `experimental_prewarm_query_plan_cache: true` to `persisted_queries` configures the router to prewarm the query plan cache on startup using the persisted query list. All subsequent requests benefit from the warmed cache, reducing latency and enhancing performance.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
persisted_queries:
  enabled: true
  experimental_prewarm_query_plan_cache: true # default: false
```

#### `experimental_local_manifests`

<ExperimentalFeature />

Adding `experimental_local_manifests` to your `persisted-queries` configuration lets you use local persisted query manifests instead of the hosted Uplink version. This is helpful when you're using an offline Enterprise license and can't use Uplink. With the  `experimental_local_manifests`, the router doesn't reload the manifest from the file system, so you need to restart the router to apply changes.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
persisted_queries:
  enabled: true
  experimental_local_manifests: 
    - ./path/to/persisted-query-manifest.json
```

You can download a version of your manifest to use locally from [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content). Open the PQL page for a graph by clicking the **Go to persisted query lists** to the left of the graph's name. Then, click the ••• menu under the **Actions** column to download a PQL's manifest as a JSON file. Save this file locally and update your `experimental_local_manifests` configuration with the path the file.

#### `safelist`

Adding `safelist: true` to `persisted_queries` causes the router to reject any operations that haven't been registered to your PQL.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
persisted_queries:
  enabled: true
  safelist:
    enabled: true
apq:
  enabled: false
```

<Note>

To enable safelisting, you _must_ turn off [automatic persisted queries](./in-memory-caching#caching-automatic-persisted-queries-apq) (APQs). APQs let clients [register arbitrary operations at runtime](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries/#differences-from-automatic-persisted-queries) while safelisting restricts operations to those that have been explicitly registered.

</Note>

By default, the [`require_id`](#required_id) suboption is `false`, meaning the router accepts both operation IDs and operation strings as long as the operation is registered.

#### `require_id`

Adding `require_id: true` to the `safelist` option causes the router to reject any operations that either:
- haven't been registered to your PQL
- use a full operation string rather than the operation ID

```yaml title="router.yaml"
persisted_queries:
  enabled: true
  safelist:
    enabled: true
    require_id: true
apq:
  enabled: false
```

<Note>

To enable safelisting, you _must_ turn off [automatic persisted queries](./in-memory-caching#caching-automatic-persisted-queries-apq) (APQs). APQs let clients [register arbitrary operations at runtime](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries/#differences-from-automatic-persisted-queries) while safelisting restricts operations to those that have been explicitly registered.

</Note>

## Limitations

* **Unsupported with offline license**. An Apollo Router using an [offline Enterprise license](../enterprise-features/#offline-enterprise-license) cannot use safelisting with persisted queries. The feature relies on Apollo Uplink to fetch persisted query manifests, so it doesn't work as designed when the router is disconnected from Uplink.
