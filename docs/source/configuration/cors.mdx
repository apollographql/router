The Apollo Router supports [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (CORS) to indicate which origins it accepts requests from. **By default, the router accepts requests from the Apollo studio**.

If your environment has security requirements around CORS, you can specify them in the router's [configuration file](./overview/#configuration-file):

```yaml title="router.yaml"
server:
  #
  # CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
  #
  cors:

    # Set to true to allow any origin
    # (Defaults to false)
    allow_any_origin: true

    # List of accepted origins
    # (Ignored if allow_any_origin is true)
    # (Defaults to the Apollo Studio url: `https://studio.apollographql.com`)
    origins:
      - https://www.my-frontend.com

    # Set to true to add the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header
    # (Defaults to false)
    allow_credentials: true

    # The headers to allow.
    # (Defaults to [ Content-Type ], which is required for Apollo Studio)
    allow_headers: [ Content-Type, Authorization ]

    # Allowed request methods
    # (Defaults to [ GET, POST, OPTIONS ])
    methods: [ POST, OPTIONS ]

    # Which response headers are available to scripts running in the
    # browser in response to a cross-origin request.
    # (Defaults to empty array)
    expose_headers: []
```
