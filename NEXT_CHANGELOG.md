# [0.10.1] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd
## ❗ BREAKING ❗
## 🚀 Features

### Add support to add custom resources on metrics. [PR #1354](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1354)

Resources are almost like attributes but there are more globals. They are directly configured on the metrics exporter which means you'll always have these resources on each of your metrics. It could be pretty useful to set
a service name for example to let you more easily find metrics related to a specific service.

```yaml
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      resources:
        # Set the service name to easily find metrics related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
        service.name: "apollo-router"
```
