description: Run the Apollo Router with Apollo-hosted subgraphs
---

Hello! This tutorial walks you through installing the Apollo Router and running it in front of some Apollo-hosted example subgraphs.

## 1. Download and extract the Apollo Router binary

### Automatic download (Linux, OSX, WSL)

If you have a bash compatible terminal you can download the latest version of the Apollo Router directly to your current directory.
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apollographql/router/main/scripts/install.sh)  
```

### Manual download
Go to the Apollo Router's [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases) and download the latest `.tar.gz` file that matches your system. Currently, tarballs are available for the following:

* Linux (x86_64)
* macOS (x86_64)
* Windows (x86_64)

> If a tarball for your system or architecture isn't available, you can [build and run Apollo Router from source](https://github.com/apollographql/router/blob/HEAD/DEVELOPMENT.md#development-1).  You can also [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/new/choose) for us to consider adding new architectures.

After downloading, extract the file by running the following from a new project directory, substituting the path to the tarball:

```bash
tar -xf path/to/file.tar.gz
```

You can now try running Apollo Router from your project's root directory with the following command:

```bash
./dist/router
```

If you do, you'll get the following:

```
APOLLO ROUTER <version>

‚ö†Ô∏è  The Apollo Router requires a composed supergraph schema at startup. ‚ö†Ô∏è

üëâ DO ONE:

  * Pass a local schema file with the '--supergraph' option:

      $ ./router --supergraph <file_path>

  * Fetch a registered schema from Apollo Studio by setting
    these environment variables:

      $ APOLLO_KEY="..." APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="..." ./router

      For details, see the Apollo docs:
      https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/managed-federation/setup

üî¨ TESTING THINGS OUT?

  1. Download an example supergraph schema with Apollo-hosted subgraphs:

    $ curl -L https://supergraph.demo.starstuff.dev/ > starstuff.graphql

  2. Run the Apollo Router with the supergraph schema:

    $ ./router --supergraph starstuff.graphql
```

This is because Apollo Router requires a supergraph schema and we aren't providing it one! Let's fix that.

## 2. Download the example supergraph schema

For this quickstart, we're using example Apollo-hosted subgraphs, along with an example supergraph schema that's composed from their schemas.

From your project's root directory, run the following:

```bash
curl -sSL https://supergraph.demo.starstuff.dev/ > supergraph-schema.graphql
```

This saves a `supergraph-schema.graphql` file with the following contents:

  name: String @join__field(graph: ACCOUNTS)
  reviews: [Review] @join__field(graph: REVIEWS)
  username: String @join__field(graph: ACCOUNTS)
}
```

This file is all that Apollo Router needs to communicate with our subgraphs!

## 3. Run the router with the default configuration

Now from your project root, run the following:

```sh
./dist/router --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
```

The console output should look like the following:

```sh
2022-03-14T11:56:55.900207Z  INFO apollo_router: Starting Apollo Router
2022-03-14T11:56:56.000707Z  INFO apollo_router: Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4000 üöÄ
```

That's it! Visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000` to open [Apollo Sandbox](/studio/explorer/sandbox/). You can inspect the entire federated graph and run your first queries against the Apollo Router!

## Next steps

Now that you know how to run Apollo Router with a supergraph schema, you can:

* Set up [managed federation](./managed-federation/overview)
* Learn about [additional configuration options](./configuration/overview)
