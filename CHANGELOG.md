# Changelog

All notable changes to Router will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

# [v0.1.0-preview.3] - 2022-04-08
## üöÄ Features
- **Add version flag to router** ([PR #805](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/805))

  You can now provider a `--version or -V` flag to the router. It will output version information and terminate.

- **New startup message** ([PR #780](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/780))

  The router startup message was updated with more links to documentation and version information.

- **Add better support of introspection queries** ([PR #802](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/802))

  Before this feature the Router didn't execute all the introspection queries, only a small number of the most common ones were executed. Now it detects if it's an introspection query, tries to fetch it from cache, if it's not in the cache we execute it and put the response in the cache.

- **Add an option to disable the landing page** ([PR #801](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/801))

  By default the router will display a landing page, which could be useful in development. If this is not
  desirable the router can be configured to not display this landing page:
  ```yaml
  server:
    landing_page: false
  ```

- **Add support of metrics in `apollo.telemetry` plugin** ([PR #738](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/738))

  The Router will now compute different metrics you can expose via Prometheus or OTLP exporter.

  Example of configuration to export an endpoint (configured with the path `/plugins/apollo.telemetry/metrics`) with metrics in `Prometheus` format:

  ```yaml
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      exporter:
        prometheus:
          # By setting this endpoint you enable the prometheus exporter
          # All our endpoints exposed by plugins are namespaced by the name of the plugin
          # Then to access to this prometheus endpoint, the full url path will be `/plugins/apollo.telemetry/metrics`
          endpoint: "/metrics"
    ```

- **Add experimental support of `custom_endpoint` method in `Plugin` trait** ([PR #738](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/738))

  The `custom_endpoint` method lets you declare a new endpoint exposed for your plugin. For now it's only accessible for official `apollo.` plugins and for `experimental.`. The return type of this method is a Tower [`Service`]().
  
- **configurable subgraph error redaction** ([PR #797](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/797))
  By default, subgraph errors are not propagated to the user. This experimental plugin allows messages to be propagated either for all subgraphs or on
  an individual subgraph basis. Individual subgraph configuration overrides the default (all) configuration. The configuration mechanism is similar
  to that used in the `headers` plugin:
  ```yaml
  plugins:
    experimental.include_subgraph_errors:
      all: true
  ```

- **Add a trace level log for subgraph queries** ([PR #808](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/808))

  To debug the query plan execution, we added log messages to print the query plan, and for each subgraph query,
  the operation, variables and response. It can be activated as follows:

  ```
  router -s supergraph.graphql --log info,apollo_router_core::query_planner::log=trace
  ```

## üêõ Fixes
- **Eliminate memory leaks when tasks are cancelled** [PR #758](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/758)

  The deduplication layer could leak memory when queries were cancelled and never retried: leaks were previously cleaned up on the next similar query. Now the leaking data will be deleted right when the query is cancelled

- **Trim the query to better detect an empty query** ([PR #738](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/738))

  Before this fix, if you wrote a query with only whitespaces inside, it wasn't detected as an empty query.

- **Keep the original context in `RouterResponse` when returning an error** ([PR #738](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/738))

  This fix keeps the original http request in `RouterResponse` when there is an error.

- **add a user-agent header to the studio usage ingress submission** ([PR #773](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/773))

  Requests to Studio now identify the router and its version

## üõ† Maintenance
- **A faster Query planner** ([PR #768](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/768))

  We reworked the way query plans are generated before being cached, which lead to a great performance improvement. Moreover, the router is able to make sure the schema is valid at startup and on schema update, before you query it.

- **Xtask improvements** ([PR #604](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/604))

  The command we run locally to make sure tests, lints and compliance-checks pass will now edit the license file and run cargo fmt so you can directly commit it before you open a Pull Request

- **Switch from reqwest to a Tower client for subgraph services** ([PR #769](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/769))

  It results in better performance due to less URL parsing, and now header propagation falls under the apollo_router_core log filter, making it harder to disable accidentally

- **Remove OpenSSL usage** ([PR #783](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/783) and [PR #810](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/810))

  OpenSSL is used for HTTPS clients when connecting to subgraphs or the Studio API. It is now replaced with rustls, which is faster to compile and link

- **Download the Studio protobuf schema during build** ([PR #776](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/776)

  The schema was vendored before, now it is downloaded dynamically during the build process

- **Fix broken benchmarks** ([PR #797](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/797))

  the `apollo-router-benchmarks` project was failing due to changes in the query planner. It is now fixed, and its subgraph mocking code is now available in `apollo-router-core`

## üìö Documentation

- **Document the Plugin and DynPlugin trait** ([PR #800](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/800)

  Those traits are used to extend the router with Rust plugins
  
# [v0.1.0-preview.2] - 2022-04-01
## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **CORS default Configuration** ([#40](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/40))

  The Router will allow only the https://studio.apollographql.com origin by default, instead of any origin.
  This behavior can still be tweaked in the [YAML configuration](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/cors)

- **Hot reload flag** ([766](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/766))
  The `--watch` (or `-w`) flag that enables hot reload was renamed to `--hr` or `--hot-reload`

## üöÄ Features

- **Hot reload via en environment variable** ([766](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/766))
  You can now use the `ROUTER_HOT_RELOAD=true` environment variable to have the router watch for configuration and schema changes and automatically reload.

- **Container images are now available** ([PR #764](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/764))

  We now build container images More details at:
    https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/router

  You can use the images with docker, for example, as follows:
    e.g.: docker pull ghcr.io/apollographql/router:v0.1.0-preview.1

  The images are based on [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) which is a very constrained image, intended to be secure and small.

  We'll provide release and debug images for each release. The debug image has a busybox shell which can be accessed using (for instance) `--entrypoint=sh`.

  For more details about these images, see the docs.

- **Skip and Include directives in post processing** ([PR #626](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/626))

  The Router now understands the [@skip](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec--skip) and [@include](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec--include) directives in queries, to add or remove fields depending on variables. It works in post processing, by filtering fields after aggregating the subgraph responses.

- **Add an option to deactivate introspection** ([PR #749](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/749))

  While schema introspection is useful in development, we might not want to expose the entire schema in production,
  so the router can be configured to forbid introspection queries as follows:
  ```yaml
  server:
    introspection: false
  ```

## üêõ Fixes
- **Move query dedup to an experimental `traffic_shaping` plugin** ([PR #753](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/753))

  The experimental `traffic_shaping` plugin will be a central location where we can add things such as rate limiting and retry.

- **Remove `hasNext` from our response objects** ([PR #733](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/733))

  `hasNext` is a field in the response that may be used in future to support features such as defer and stream. However, we are some way off supporting this and including it now may break clients. It has been removed.

- **Extend Apollo uplink configurability** ([PR #741](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/741))

  Uplink url and poll interval can now be configured via command line arg and env variable:
  ```bash
    --apollo-schema-config-delivery-endpoint <apollo-schema-config-delivery-endpoint>
      The endpoint polled to fetch the latest supergraph schema [env: APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT=]

    --apollo-schema-poll-interval <apollo-schema-poll-interval>
      The time between polls to Apollo uplink. Minimum 10s [env: APOLLO_SCHEMA_POLL_INTERVAL=]  [default: 10s]
  ```
  In addition, other existing uplink env variables are now also configurable via arg. 

- **Make deduplication and caching more robust against cancellation** [PR #752](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/752)

  Cancelling a request could put the router in an unresponsive state where the deduplication layer or cache would make subgraph requests hang.

- **Relax variables selection for subgraph queries** ([PR #755](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/755))

  Federated subgraph queries relying on partial or invalid data from previous subgraph queries could result in response failures or empty subgraph queries. The router is now more flexible when selecting data from previous queries, while still keeping a correct form for the final response

# [v0.1.0-preview.1] - 2022-03-23

## üéâ **The Apollo Router has graduated to its Preview phase!** üéâ
## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **Improvements to telemetry attribute YAML ergonomics** ([PR #729](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/729))

  Trace config YAML ergonomics have been improved. To add additional attributes to your trace information, you can now use the following format:

  ```yaml
        trace_config:
          attributes:
            str: "a"
            int: 1
            float: 1.0
            bool: true
            str_arr:
              - "a"
              - "b"
            int_arr:
              - 1
              - 2
            float_arr:
              - 1.0
              - 2.0
            bool_arr:
              - true
              - false
  ```
## üêõ Fixes

- **Log and error message formatting** ([PR #721](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/721))

  Logs and error messages now begin with lower case and do not have trailing punctuation, per Rust conventions.

- **OTLP default service.name and service.namespace** ([PR #722](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/722))

  While the Jaeger YAML configuration would default to `router` for the `service.name` and to `apollo` for the `service.namespace`, it was not the case when using a configuration that utilized OTLP. This lead to an `UNKNOWN_SERVICE` name span in zipkin traces, and difficult to find Jaeger traces.

# [v0.1.0-preview.0] - 2022-03-22

## üéâ **The Apollo Router has graduated to its Preview phase!** üéâ

For more information on what's expected at this stage, please see our [release stages](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/release-stages/#preview).

## üêõ Fixes

- **Header propagation by `name` only fixed** ([PR #709](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/709))

  Previously `rename` and `default` values were required (even though they were correctly not flagged as required in the json schema).
  The following will now work:
  ```yaml
  headers:
    all:
    - propagate:
        named: test
  ```
- **Fix OTLP hang on reload** ([PR #711](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/711))

  Fixes hang when OTLP exporter is configured and configuration hot reloads.

# [v0.1.0-alpha.10] 2022-03-21

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **Header propagation `remove`'s `name` is now `named`** ([PR #674](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/674))

  This merely renames the `remove` options' `name` setting to be instead `named` to be a bit more intuitively named and consistent with its partner configuration, `propagate`.

  _Previous configuration_

  ```yaml
    # Remove a named header
    - remove:
      name: "Remove" # Was: "name"
  ```
  _New configuration_

  ```yaml
    # Remove a named header
    - remove:
      named: "Remove" # Now: "named"
  ```

- **Command-line flag vs Environment variable precedence changed** ([PR #693](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/693))

  For logging related verbosity overrides, the `RUST_LOG` environment variable no longer takes precedence over the command line argument.  The full order of precedence is now command-line argument overrides environment variable overrides the default setting.

## üöÄ Features

- **Forbid mutations plugin** ([PR #641](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/641))

  The forbid mutations plugin allows you to configure the router so that it disallows mutations.  Assuming none of your `query` requests are mutating data or changing state (they shouldn't!) this plugin can be used to effectively make your graph read-only. This can come in handy when testing the router, for example, if you are mirroring/shadowing traffic when trying to validate a Gateway to Router migration! üò∏

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Add experimental Rhai plugin** ([PR #484](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/484))

  Add an _experimental_ core plugin to be able to extend Apollo Router functionality using [Rhai script](https://rhai.rs/). This allows users to write their own `*_service` function similar to how as you would with a native Rust plugin but without needing to compile a custom router. Rhai scripts have access to the request context and headers directly and can make simple manipulations on them.

  See our [Rhai script documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/rhai) for examples and details!

## üêõ Fixes

- **Correctly set the URL path of the HTTP request in `RouterRequest`** ([Issue #699](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/699))

  Previously, we were not setting the right HTTP path on the `RouterRequest` so when writing a plugin with `router_service` you always had an empty path `/` on `RouterRequest`.

## üìö Documentation

- **We have incorporated a substantial amount of documentation** (via many, many PRs!)

  See our improved documentation [on our website](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/).

# [v0.1.0-alpha.9] 2022-03-16
## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

- **Header propagation configuration changes** ([PR #599](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/599))

  Header manipulation configuration is now a core-plugin and configured at the _top-level_ of the Router's configuration file, rather than its previous location within service-level layers.  Some keys have also been renamed.  For example:

  **Previous configuration**

  ```yaml
  subgraphs:
    products:
      layers:
        - headers_propagate:
            matching:
              regex: .*
  ```

  **New configuration**

  ```yaml
  headers:
    subgraphs:
      products:
        - propagate:
          matching: ".*"
  ```

- **Move Apollo plugins to top-level configuration** ([PR #623](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/623))

  Previously plugins were all under the `plugins:` section of the YAML config.  However, these "core" plugins are now promoted to the top-level of the config. This reflects the fact that these plugins provide core functionality even though they are implemented as plugins under the hood and further reflects the fact that they receive special treatment in terms of initialization order (they are initialized first before members of `plugins`).

- **Remove configurable layers** ([PR #603](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/603))

  Having `plugins` _and_ `layers` as configurable items in YAML was creating confusion as to when it was appropriate to use a `layer` vs a `plugin`.  As the layer API is a subset of the plugin API, `plugins` has been kept, however the `layer` option has been dropped.

- **Plugin names have dropped the `com.apollographql` prefix** ([PR #602](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/600))

  Previously, core plugins were prefixed with `com.apollographql.`.  This is no longer the case and, when coupled with the above moving of the core plugins to the top-level, the prefixing is no longer present.  This means that, for example, `com.apollographql.telemetry` would now be just `telemetry`.

- **Use `ControlFlow` in checkpoints** ([PR #602](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/602))


- **Add Rhai plugin** ([PR #548](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/484))

  Both `checkpoint` and `async_checkpoint` now `use std::ops::ControlFlow` instead of the `Step` enum.  `ControlFlow` has two variants, `Continue` and `Break`.

- **The `reporting` configuration changes to `telemetry`** ([PR #651](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/651))

  All configuration that was previously under the `reporting` header is now under a `telemetry` key.
## :sparkles: Features

- **Header propagation now supports "all" subgraphs** ([PR #599](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/599))

  It is now possible to configure header propagation rules for *all* subgraphs without needing to explicitly name each subgraph.  You can accomplish this by using the `all` key, under the (now relocated; see above _breaking changes_) `headers` section.

  ```yaml
  headers:
    all:
    - propagate:
      matching: "aaa.*"
    - propagate:
      named: "bbb"
      default: "def"
      rename: "ccc"
    - insert:
      name: "ddd"
      value: "eee"
    - remove:
      matching: "fff.*"
    - remove:
      name: "ggg"
  ```

- **Update to latest query planner from Federation 2** ([PR #653](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/653))

  The Router now uses the `@apollo/query-planner@2.0.0-preview.5` query planner, bringing the most recent version of Federation 2.

## üêõ Fixes

- **`Content-Type` of HTTP responses is now set to `application/json`** ([Issue #639](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/639))

  Previously, we were not setting a `content-type` on HTTP responses.  While plugins can still set a different `content-type` if they'd like, we now ensure that a `content-type` of `application/json` is set when one was not already provided.

- **GraphQL Enums in query parameters** ([Issue #612](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/612))

  Enums in query parameters were handled correctly in the response formatting, but not in query validation.  We now have a new test and a fix.

- **OTel trace propagation works again** ([PR #620](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/620))

  When we re-worked our OTel implementation to be a plugin, the ability to trace across processes (into subgraphs) was lost. This fix restores this capability.  We are working to improve our end-to-end testing of this to prevent further regressions.

- **Reporting plugin schema generation** ([PR #607](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/607))

  Previously our `reporting` plugin configuration was not able to participate in JSON Schema generation. This is now broadly correct and makes writing a syntactically-correct schema much easier.

  To generate a schema, you can still run the same command as before:

  ```
  router --schema > apollo_configuration_schema.json
  ```

  Then, follow the instructions for associating it with your development environment.

- **Input object validation** ([PR #658](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/658))

  Variable validation was incorrectly using output objects instead of input objects

# [v0.1.0-alpha.8] 2022-03-08

## :sparkles: Features

- **Request lifecycle checkpoints** ([PR #558](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/548) and [PR #580](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/548))

    Checkpoints in the request pipeline now allow plugin authors (which includes us!) to check conditions during a request's lifecycle and circumvent further execution if desired.
    
    Using `Step` return types within the checkpoint it's possible to influence what happens (including changing things like the HTTP status code, etc.).  A caching layer, for example, could return `Step::Return(response)` if a cache "hit" occurred and `Step::Continue(request)` (to allow normal processing to continue) in the event of a cache "miss".
    
    These can be either synchronous or asynchronous.  To see examples, see:
    
    - A [synchronous example](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/190afe181bf2c50be1761b522fcbdcc82b81d6ca/examples/forbid-anonymous-operations)
    - An [asynchronous example](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/190afe181bf2c50be1761b522fcbdcc82b81d6ca/examples/async-allow-client-id)

- **Contracts support** ([PR #573](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/573))

  The Apollo Router now supports [Apollo Studio Contracts](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/contracts/)!

- **Add OpenTracing support** ([PR #548](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/548))

  OpenTracing support has been added into the reporting plugin.  You're now able to have span propagation (via headers) via two common formats supported by the `opentracing` crate: `zipkin_b3` and `jaeger`.


## :bug: Fixes

- **Configuration no longer requires `router_url`** ([PR #553](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/553))

  When using Managed Federation or directly providing a Supergraph file, it is no longer necessary to provide a `routing_url` value.  Instead, the values provided by the Supergraph or Studio will be used and the `routing_url` can be used only to override specific URLs for specific subgraphs.

- **Fix plugin ordering** ([PR #559](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/559))

  Plugins need to execute in sequence of declaration *except* for certain "core" plugins (e.g., reporting) which must execute early in the plugin sequence to make sure they are in place as soon as possible in the Router lifecycle. This change now ensures that the reporting plugin executes first and that all other plugins are executed in the order of declaration in configuration.

- **Propagate Router operation lifecycle errors** ([PR #537](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/537))

  Our recent extension rework was missing a key part: Error propagation and handling! This change makes sure errors that occurred during query planning and query execution will be displayed as GraphQL errors instead of an empty payload.


# [v0.1.0-alpha.7] 2022-02-25

## :sparkles: Features

- **Apollo Studio Explorer landing page** ([PR #526](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/526))

  We've replaced the _redirect_ to Apollo Studio with a statically rendered landing page.  This supersedes the previous redirect approach was merely introduced as a short-cut.  The experience now duplicates the user-experience which exists in Apollo Gateway today.

  It is also possible to _save_ the redirect preference and make the behavior sticky for future visits.  As a bonus, this also resolves the failure to preserve the correct HTTP scheme (e.g., `https://`) in the event that the Apollo Router was operating behind a TLS-terminating proxy, since the redirect is now handled client-side.

  Overall, this should be a more durable and more transparent experience for the user.

- **Display Apollo Router version on startup** ([PR #543](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/543))
  The Apollo Router displays its version on startup from now on, which will come in handy when debugging/observing how your application behaves.

## :bug: Fixes

- **Passing a `--supergraph` file supersedes Managed Federation** ([PR #535](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/535))

  The `--supergraph` flag will no longer be silently ignored when the Supergraph is already being provided through [Managed Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/overview) (i.e., when the `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variables are set).  This allows temporarily overriding the Supergraph schema that is fetched from Apollo Studio's Uplink endpoint, while still reporting metrics to Apollo Studio reporting ingress.

- **Anonymous operation names are now empty in tracing** ([PR #525](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/525))

  When GraphQL operation names are not necessary to execute an operation (i.e., when there is only a single operation in a GraphQL document) and the GraphQL operation is _not_ named (i.e., it is anonymous), the `operation_name` attribute on the trace spans that are associated with the request will no longer contain a single hyphen character (`-`) but will instead be an empty string.  This matches the way that these operations are represented during the GraphQL operation's life-cycle as well.

- **Resolved missing documentation in Apollo Explorer** ([PR #540](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/540))

   We've resolved a scenario that prevented Apollo Explorer from displaying documentation by adding support for a new introspection query which also queries for deprecation (i.e., `includeDeprecated`) on `input` arguments.
  
# [v0.1.0-alpha.6] 2022-02-18

## :sparkles: Features

- **Apollo Studio Managed Federation support** ([PR #498](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/498))

  [Managed Federation]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/overview/

  The Router can now automatically download and check for updates on its schema from Studio (via [Uplink])'s free, [Managed Federation] service.  This is configured in the same way as Apollo Gateway via the `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variables, in the same way as was true in Apollo Gateway ([seen here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/setup/#4-connect-the-gateway-to-studio)). This will also enable operation usage reporting.

  > **Note:** It is not yet possible to configure the Router with [`APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT`].  If you need this behavior, please open a feature request with your use case.

- **Subgraph header configuration** ([PR #453](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/453))

  The Router now supports passing both client-originated and router-originated headers to specific subgraphs using YAML configuration.  Each subgraph which needs to receive headers can specify which headers (or header patterns) should be forwarded to which subgraph.

  More information can be found in our documentation on [subgraph header configuration].

  At the moment, when using using YAML configuration alone, router-originated headers can only be static strings (e.g., `sent-from-apollo-router: true`).  If you have use cases for deriving headers in the router dynamically, please open or find a feature request issue on the repository which explains the use case.

- **In-flight subgraph `query` de-duplication** ([PR #285](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/285))

  As a performance booster to both the Router and the subgraphs it communicates with, the Router will now _de-duplicate_ multiple _identical_ requests to subgraphs when there are multiple in-flight requests to the same subgraph with the same `query` (**never** `mutation`s), headers, and GraphQL `variables`.  Instead, a single request will be made to the subgraph and the many client requests will be served via that single response.

  There may be a substantial drop in number of requests observed by subgraphs with this release.

- **Operations can now be made via `GET` requests** ([PR #429](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/429))

  The Router now supports `GET` requests for `query` operations.  Previously, the Apollo Router only supported making requests via `POST` requests.  We've always intended on supporting `GET` support, but needed some additional support in place to make sure we could prevent allowing `mutation`s to happen over `GET` requests.

- **Automatic persisted queries (APQ) support** ([PR #433](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/433))

  The Router now handles [automatic persisted queries (APQ)] by default, as was previously the case in Apollo Gateway.  APQ support pairs really well with `GET` requests (which also landed in this release) since they allow read operations (e.g., `GET` requests) to be more easily cached by intermediary proxies and CDNs, which typically forbid caching `POST` requests by specification (even if they often are just reads in GraphQL).  Follow the link above to the documentation to test them out.

  [automatic persisted queries (APQ)]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/

- **New internal Tower architecture and preparation for extensibility** ([PR #319](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/319))

  We've introduced new foundational primitives to the Router's request pipeline which facilitate the creation of composable _onion layers_.  For now, this is largely leveraged through a series of internal refactors and we'll need to document and expand on more of the details that facilitate developers building their own custom extensions.  To leverage existing art &mdash; and hopefully maximize compatibility and facilitate familiarity &mdash; we've leveraged the [Tokio Tower `Service`] pattern.

  This should facilitate a number of interesting extension opportunities and we're excited for what's in-store next.  We intend on improving and iterating on the API's ergonomics for common Graph Router behaviors over time, and we'd encourage you to open issues on the repository with use-cases you might think need consideration.

  [Tokio Tower `Service`]: https://docs.rs/tower/latest/tower/trait.Service.html

- **Support for Jaeger HTTP collector in OpenTelemetry** ([PR #479](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/479))

  It is now possible to configure Jaeger HTTP collector endpoints within the `opentelemetry` configuration.  Previously, Router only supported the UDP method.

  The [documentation] has also been updated to demonstrate how this can be configured.

  [documentation]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#using-jaeger

## :bug: Fixes

- **Studio agent collector now binds to localhost** [PR #486](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pulls/486)

  The Studio agent collector will bind to `127.0.0.1`.  It can be configured to bind to `0.0.0.0` if desired (e.g., if you're using the collector to collect centrally) by using the [`spaceport.listener` property] in the documentation.

  [`spaceport.listener` property]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#spaceport-configuration

# [v0.1.0-alpha.5] 2022-02-15

## :sparkles: Features

- **Apollo Studio usage reporting agent and operation-level reporting** ([PR #309](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pulls/309), [PR #420](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pulls/420))

  While there are several levels of Apollo Studio integration, the initial phase of our Apollo Studio reporting focuses on operation-level reporting.

  At a high-level, this will allow Apollo Studio to have visibility into some basic schema details, like graph ID and variant, and per-operation details, including:
  
  - Overall operation latency
  - The number of times the operation is executed
  - [Client awareness] reporting, which leverages the `apollographql-client-*` headers to give visibility into _which clients are making which operations_.

  This should enable several Apollo Studio features including the _Clients_ and _Checks_ pages as well as the _Checks_ tab on the _Operations_ page.
  
  > *Note:* As a current limitation, the _Fields_ page will not have detailed field-based metrics and on the _Operations_ page the _Errors_ tab, the _Traces_ tab and the _Error Percentage_ graph will not receive data.  We recommend configuring the Router's [OpenTelemetry tracing] with your APM provider and using distributed tracing to increase visibility into individual resolver performance.

  Overall, this marks a notable but still incremental progress toward more of the Studio integrations which are laid out in [#66](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/66).

  [Client awareness]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/metrics/client-awareness/
  [Schema checks]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/schema-checks/
  [OpenTelemetry tracing]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#tracing

- **Complete GraphQL validation** ([PR #471](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/471) via [federation-rs#37](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-rs/pull/37))

  We now apply all of the standard validations which are defined in the `graphql` (JavaScript) implementation's default set of "[specified rules]" during query planning.

  [specified rules]: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/95dac43fd4bff037e06adaa7cfb44f497bca94a7/src/validation/specifiedRules.ts#L76-L103

## :bug: Fixes

- **No more double `http://http://` in logs** ([PR #448](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pulls/448))

  The server logs will no longer advertise the listening host and port with a doubled-up `http://` prefix.  You can once again click happily into Studio Explorer!

- **Improved handling of Federation 1 supergraphs** ([PR #446](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/446) via [federation#1511](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1511))

  Our partner team has improved the handling of Federation 1 supergraphs in the implementation of Federation 2 alpha (which the Router depends on and is meant to offer compatibility with Federation 1 in most cases).  We've updated our query planner implementation to the version with the fixes.

  This also was the first time that we've leveraged the new [`federation-rs`] repository to handle our bridge, bringing a huge developmental advantage to teams working across the various concerns!

  [`federation-rs`]: https://github.com/apollographql/federation-rs

- **Resolved incorrect subgraph ordering during merge** ([PR #460](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/460))

  A fix was applied to fix the behavior which was identified in [Issue #451] which was caused by a misconfigured filter which was being applied to field paths.

  [Issue #451]: https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/451
# [v0.1.0-alpha.4] 2022-02-03

## :sparkles: Features

- **Unix socket support** via [#158](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/158)

  _...and via upstream [`tokios-rs/tokio#4385`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/4385)_

  The Router can now listen on Unix domain sockets (i.e., IPC) in addition to the existing IP-based (port) listening.  This should bring further compatibility with upstream intermediaries who also allow support this form of communication!

  _(Thank you to [@cecton](https://github.com/cecton), both for the PR that landed this feature but also for contributing the upstream PR to `tokio`.)_

## :bug: Fixes

- **Resolved hangs occurring on Router reload when `jaeger` was configured** via [#337](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/337)

  Synchronous calls being made to [`opentelemetry::global::set_tracer_provider`] were causing the runtime to misbehave when the configuration (file) was adjusted (and thus, hot-reloaded) on account of the root context of that call being asynchronous.

  This change adjusts the call to be made from a new thread.  Since this only affected _potential_ runtime configuration changes (again, hot-reloads on a configuration change), the thread spawn is  a reasonable solution.

  [`opentelemetry::global::set_tracer_provider`]: https://docs.rs/opentelemetry/0.10.0/opentelemetry/global/fn.set_tracer_provider.html

## :nail_care: Improvements

> Most of the improvements this time are internal to the code-base but that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about them.  A great developer experience matters both internally and externally! :smile_cat:

- **Store JSON strings in a `bytes::Bytes` instance** via [#284](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/284)

  The router does a a fair bit of deserialization, filtering, aggregation and re-serializing of JSON objects.  Since we currently operate on a dynamic schema, we've been relying on [`serde_json::Value`] to represent this data internally.

  After this change, that `Value` type is now replaced with an equivalent type from a new [`serde_json_bytes`], which acts as an envelope around an underlying `bytes::Bytes`.  This allows us to refer to the buffer that contained the JSON data while avoiding the allocation and copying costs on each string for values that are largely unused by the Router directly.

  This should offer future benefits when implementing &mdash; e.g., query de-duplication and caching &mdash; since a single buffer will be usable by multiple responses at the same time.

  [`serde_json::Value`]: https://docs.rs/serde_json/0.9.8/serde_json/enum.Value.html
  [`serde_json_bytes`]: https://crates.io/crates/serde_json_bytes
  [`bytes::Bytes`]: https://docs.rs/bytes/0.4.12/bytes/struct.Bytes.html

-  **Development workflow improvement** via [#367](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/367)

   Polished away some existing _Problems_ reported by `rust-analyzer` and added troubleshooting instructions to our documentation.

- **Removed unnecessary `Arc` from `PreparedQuery`'s `execute`** via [#328](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/328)

  _...and followed up with [#367](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/367)_

- **Bumped/upstream improvements to `test_span`** via [#359](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/359)

  _...and [`apollographql/test-span#11`](https://github.com/apollographql/test-span/pull/11) upstream_

  Internally, this is just a version bump to the Router, but it required upstream changes to the `test-span` crate.  The bump brings new filtering abilities and adjusts the verbosity of spans tracing levels, and removes non-determinism from tests.

## :rocket::waxing_crescent_moon: Public alpha release

> An alpha or beta release is in volatile, active development. The release might not be feature-complete, and breaking API changes are possible between individual versions.

## :sparkles: Features

- Trace sampling [#228](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/228): Tracing each request can be expensive. The router now supports sampling, which allows us to only send a fraction of the received requests.

## :bug: Fixes

- Schema parse errors [#136](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/136): The router wouldn't display what went wrong when parsing an invalid Schema. It now displays exactly where a the parsing error occured, and why.

- Various tracing and telemetry fixes [#237](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/237): The router wouldn't display what went wrong when parsing an invalid Schema. It now displays exactly where a the parsing error occured, and why.

- Query variables validation [#62](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/62): Now that we have a schema parsing feature, we can validate the variables and their types against the schemas and queries.

## :bug: Fixes

- Handle commas in the @join\_\_graph directive parameters [#101](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/101)

There are several accepted syntaxes to define @join\_\_graph parameters. While we did handle whitespace separated parameters such as `@join__graph(name: "accounts" url: "http://accounts/graphql")`for example, we discarded the url in`@join__graph(name: "accounts", url: "http://accounts/graphql")` (notice the comma). This pr fixes that.

- Invert subgraph URL override logic [#135](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/135)

Subservices endpoint URLs can both be defined in `supergraph.graphql` and in the subgraphs section of the `configuration.yml` file. The configuration now correctly overrides the supergraph endpoint definition when applicable.

- Parse OTLP endpoint address [#156](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/156)

The router OpenTelemetry configuration only supported full URLs (that contain a scheme) while OpenTelemtry collectors support full URLs and endpoints, defaulting to `https`. This pull request fixes that.

## :books: Documentation

A lot of configuration examples and links have been fixed ([#117](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/117), [#120](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/120), [#133](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/133))

## :sparkles: Features

- **Federation 2 alpha**

  The Apollo Router supports the new alpha features of [Apollo Federation 2], including its improved shared ownership model and enhanced type merging.  As new Federation 2 features are released, we will update the Router to bring in that new functionality.
  
  [Apollo Federation 2]: https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/backend/announcing-federation-2/

- **Supergraph support**

  The Apollo Router supports supergraphs that are published to the Apollo Registry, or those that are composed locally.  Both options are enabled by using [Rover] to produce (`rover supergraph compose`) or fetch (`rover supergraph fetch`) the supergraph to a file.  This file is passed to the Apollo Router using the `--supergraph` flag.
  
  See the Rover documentation on [supergraphs] for more information!
  
  [Rover]: https://www.apollographql.com/rover/
  [supergraphs]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/supergraphs/

- **Query planning and execution**

  The Apollo Router supports Federation 2 query planning using the same implementation we use in Apollo Gateway for maximum compatibility.  In the future, we would like to migrate the query planner to Rust.  Query plans are cached in the Apollo Router for improved performance.
  
- **Performance**

  We've created benchmarks demonstrating the performance advantages of a Rust-based Apollo Router. Early results show a substantial performance improvement over our Node.js based Apollo Gateway, with the possibility of improving performance further for future releases. 
  
  Additionally, we are making benchmarking an integrated part of our CI/CD pipeline to allow us to monitor the changes over time.  We hope to bring awareness of this into the public purview as we have new learnings.
  
  See our [blog post] for more.
  
  [blog post]: https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/backend/apollo-router-our-graphql-federation-runtime-in-rust/
  
- **Apollo Sandbox Explorer**

  [Apollo Sandbox Explorer] is a powerful web-based IDE for creating, running, and managing GraphQL operations.  Visiting your Apollo Router endpoint will take you into the Apollo Sandbox Explorer, preconfigured to operate against your graph. 
  
  [Apollo Sandbox Explorer]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/

- **Introspection support**

  Introspection support makes it possible to immediately explore the graph that's running on your Apollo Router using the Apollo Sandbox Explorer.  Introspection is currently enabled by default on the Apollo Router.  In the future, we'll support toggling this behavior.
  
- **OpenTelemetry tracing**

  For enabling observability with existing infrastructure and monitoring performance, we've added support using [OpenTelemetry] tracing. A number of configuration options can be seen in the [configuration][configuration 1] documentation under the `opentelemetry` property which allows enabling Jaeger or [OTLP]. 
  
  In the event that you'd like to send data to other tracing platforms, the [OpenTelemetry Collector] can be run an agent and can funnel tracing (and eventually, metrics) to a number of destinations which are implemented as [exporters].

  [OpenTelemetry Collector]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector
  [exporters]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter
  
- **CORS customizations**

  For a seamless getting started story, the Apollo Router has CORS support enabled by default with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` set to `*`, allowing access to it from any browser environment.
  
  This configuration can be adjusted using the [CORS configuration] in the documentation.
  
  [CORS configuration]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#handling-cors

- **Subgraph routing URL overrides**

  Routing URLs are encoded in the supergraph, so specifying them explicitly isn't always necessary.
  
  In the event that you have dynamic subgraph URLs, or just want to quickly test something out locally, you can override subgraph URLs in the configuration.
  
  Changes to the configuration will be hot-reloaded by the running Apollo Router.
  
## üìö Documentation

  The beginnings of the [Apollo Router's documentation] is now available in the Apollo documentation. We look forward to continually improving it!

- **Quickstart tutorial**

  The [quickstart tutorial] offers a quick way to try out the Apollo Router using a pre-deployed set of subgraphs we have running in the cloud.  No need to spin up local subgraphs!  You can of course run the Apollo Router with your own subgraphs too by providing a supergraph.
  
- **Configuration options**

  On our [configuration][configuration 2] page we have a set of descriptions for some common configuration options (e.g., supergraph and CORS) as well as a [full configuration] file example of the currently supported options.
