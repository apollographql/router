## Enabling licensed plan features

To enable licensed plan features in a router:

- You must run GraphOS Router v1.12 or later. [Download the latest version.](/graphos/reference/router/self-hosted-install#1-download-and-extract-the-router-binary)
  - Certain features might require a later router version. See a particular feature's documentation for details.
- Your router instances must connect to GraphOS with a **graph API key** and **graph ref** associated with your organization.
  - You connect your router to GraphOS by setting [these environment variables](/graphos/reference/router/configuration#environment-variables) when starting the router.
