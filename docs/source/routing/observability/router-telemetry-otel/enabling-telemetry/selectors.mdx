A _selector_ is used to extract data from the GraphOS Router's request lifecycle (pipeline) services and attach them to telemetry, specifically [spans](/router/configuration/telemetry/instrumentation/spans), [instruments](/router/configuration/telemetry/instrumentation/instruments), [conditions](/router/configuration/telemetry/instrumentation/conditions) and [events](/router/configuration/telemetry/instrumentation/events).

An example of a selector, `request_header`, of the router service on a custom span attribute:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      mode: spec_compliant
      router:
        attributes:
          "my_attribute":
            # ...
            request_header: "x-my-header" #highlight-line
```

## Selector configuration reference

Each service of the router pipeline (`router`, `supergraph`, `subgraph`, `connector`) has its own available selectors.
You can also extract GraphQL metrics from the response data the router returns to clients.

### Router

The router service is the initial entrypoint for all requests. It is HTTP centric and deals with opaque bytes.

### HTTP Client

The HTTP client service also executes multiple times, with each execution representing a HTTP request to a single subgraph or REST service. Importantly, this service executes after any Rhai scripts that modify the subgraph requests, so these selectors can be used to observe any headers added by the Rhai script.

| Selector           | Defaultable | Values | Description                   |
|--------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------------------|

| `response_header`  | Yes         |        | The name of a response header |

### Connector

#### HTTP

Apollo Connectors for REST APIs make HTTP calls to the upstream HTTP API. These selectors let you extract metrics from these HTTP requests and responses.

### GraphQL

GraphQL metrics are extracted from the response data the router returns to client requests.

| Selector         | Defaultable | Values           | Description                                 |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `list_length`    | No          | `value`          | The length of a list from the response data |
| `field_name`     | No          | `string`         | The name of a field from the response data  |
| `field_type`     | No          | `string`         | The type of a field from the response data  |
| `type_name`      | No          |                  | The GraphQL type from the response data     |
| `operation_name` | Yes         | `string` \| `hash` | The operation name of the query             |
| `static`         | No          |                  | A static string value                       |


## Example selector configurations

Some example configurations of common use cases for selectors:

### Configuring trace ID

Logging the trace ID of a request that has GraphQL errors:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router:
        my.event:
          message: 'An event occurred'
          level: error
          on: response
          condition:
            eq:
              - on_graphql_error: true
              - true
          attributes:
            # The trace ID from the request
            id_from_header:
              trace_id: open_telemetry
```

### Setting JSON paths

Configuring selectors with JSON paths, such as supergraph `response_data` and `response_errors`:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    metrics:
      prometheus:
        enabled: true
  instrumentation:
    instruments:
      supergraph:
        my.request.on_graphql_error:
          value: event_unit
          type: counter
          unit: error
          description: my description
          condition:
            exists:
              response_errors: "$.[0].extensions.code"
          attributes:
            response_errors:
              response_errors: "$.[0].extensions.code"
```

### Capturing the Router Response body

The `response_body` selector allows for accessing the response body in the telemetry
configurations, enabling more detailed monitoring and logging of response data in the Router.

```yaml
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      router:
        attributes:
          "my_attribute":
            response_body: true
```

### Capturing Router Response Errors

The `response_errors` selector allows for a more granular approach towards gathering specific error
data from the Router response with JSON paths, avoiding capturing the entire response body
while still providing relevant error information.

```yaml
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router:
        router.error:
          attributes:
            "my_attribute":
              response_errors: "$.[0]"

              # Other examples:
              # response_errors: "$.[0].message"
              # response_errors: "$.[0].locations"
              # response_errors: "$.[0].extensions"
```

### Getting GraphQL operation info

Configuring the `query` selector to get information about GraphQL operations, with an example for a custom view of operation limits:

```yaml
telemetry:
  exporters:
    metrics:
      common:
        views:
          # Define a custom view because operation limits are different than the default latency-oriented view of OpenTelemetry
          - name: oplimits.*
            aggregation:
              histogram:
                buckets:
                  - 0
                  - 5
                  - 10
                  - 25
                  - 50
                  - 100
                  - 500
                  - 1000
  instrumentation:
    instruments:
      supergraph:
        oplimits.aliases:
          value:
            query: aliases
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Aliases for an operation"
        oplimits.depth:
          value:
            query: depth
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Depth for an operation"
        oplimits.height:
          value:
            query: height
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Height for an operation"
        oplimits.root_fields:
          value:
            query: root_fields
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Root fields for an operation"
```
