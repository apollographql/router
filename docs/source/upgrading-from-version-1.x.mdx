Learn how to upgrade from your GraphOS Router deployment from version 1.x to 2.x.

<Note>

The latest version of GraphOS Router v2.x is **TBD**.

</Note>

## What's different?

### New Features

There are new features in GraphOS Router v2.0 (Alpha). Think about how you can take advantage of these as you plan your upgrade to your existing 1.x deployment.

### Apollo Reporting

#### Sampling

Prior to version 1.49.0 of the router, all GraphOS reporting was performed using a [private tracing format](graphos/metrics/sending-operation-metrics#reporting-format).

In v1.49.0, we introduced support for using OTEL to perform this reporting.

In v1.x, this is controlled using the `experimental_otlp_tracing_sampler` flag, and is disabled by default.

Now in v2.x, this flag is renamed to `otlp_tracing_sampler` and is enabled by default.

Learn more in [Usage reporting via OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](/router/configuration/telemetry/apollo-telemetry#usage-reporting-via-opentelemetry-protocol-otlp).

##### Configuration

This change adds a new configuration option `otlp_tracing_sampler`. This can be used to send a percentage of traces via OTLP instead of the native Apollo Usage Reporting protocol. Supported values:

- `always_off`: send all traces via Apollo Usage Reporting protocol.
- `always_on` (default): send all traces via OTLP.
- `0.0 - 1.0`: the ratio of traces to send via OTLP (0.5 = 50 / 50).

Note that this sampler is only applied _after_ the common tracing sampler, for example:

##### Sample 1% of traces, send all traces via OTLP:

```yaml
telemetry:
  apollo:
    # Send all traces via OTLP
    otlp_tracing_sampler: always_on

  exporters:
    tracing:
      common:
        # Sample traces at 1% of all traffic
        sampler: 0.01
```

#### Metrics reporting defaults

GraphOS metrics reporting defaults are updated from 1.x as follows:

`telemetry.apollo.signature_normalization_algorithm` now defaults to `enhanced` (in 1.x this is `legacy`)
`telemetry.apollo.metrics_reference_mode` now defaults to `extended` (in 1.x this is `standard`)

## How do I upgrade?

Upgrading will generally be quick and painless, but some planning will help.

### Configuration

If you are happy to submit traces via OTEL, then no changes are required. Otherwise, use the `otlp_tracing_sampler` to turn this off and restore the default 1.x behavior.

If you are happy to use the new metrics reporting default, then no changes are required. Otherwise:

```yaml
`telemetry:
  apollo:
    signature_normalization_algorithm: legacy
    metrics_reference_mode: standard
```
will restore the default 1.x behavior.

### Deployment

Make sure that you are referencing the correct router release: v2.0.0-preview.0

During upgrade, carefully monitor resource consumption.

TBD: Write a list of all considerations and possible changes a user must make (configuration, deployment, etc.) to upgrade to 2.x. Add some text here about various changes and how they impact 1.x deployments. Perhaps talk about tooling that automates upgrade (config in particular).
