description: Configure client awareness in Apollo Router

import { Link } from "gatsby";

The Apollo Router supports [client awareness](/graphos/metrics/client-awareness/) by default. If the client sets the headers `apollographql-client-name` and `apollographql-client-version` in its HTTP requests, Apollo Studio can separate the metrics and queries per client.

## Overriding client awareness headers

Different header names can be used by updating the configuration file. If those headers will be sent by a browser, they must be allowed in the [CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) configuration](../configuration/cors), as follows:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  apollo:
    # defaults to apollographql-client-name
    client_name_header: MyClientHeaderName
    # defaults to apollographql-client-version
    client_version_header: MyClientHeaderVersion
cors:
  # The headers to allow.
  # (Defaults to [ Content-Type ], which is required for Apollo Studio)
  allow_headers: [ Content-Type, MyClientHeaderName, MyClientHeaderVersion]
```
