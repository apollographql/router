# [v0.1.0-preview.8] - (unreleased)
## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Add configuration to declare your own GraphQL endpoint [PR #976](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/976)
You are now able to declare your own GraphQL endpoint in the config like this:
```yaml
server:
  # The socket address and port to listen on
  # Defaults to 127.0.0.1:4000
  listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
  # Default is /
  endpoint: /graphql
```
But we also deleted the `/graphql` endpoint by default, you will know have only one existing GraphQL endpoint and by default it's `/`. If you need to use `/graphql` instead then refer to my previous example.

## üêõ Fixes ( :bug: )

### Improve the configuration error report [PR #963](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/963)
In case you have unknown properties on your configuration it will highlight the entity with unknown properties. Before we always pointed on the first field of this entity even if it wasn't the bad one, it's now fixed.

### Fix incorrectly omitting content of interface's fragment [PR #949](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/949)
Router now distinguish between fragment on concrete type and interface.
If interface is encountered and  `__typename` is queried, additionally checks that returned type implements interface.

### Set the service name if not specified in config or environment [PR #960](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/960)
The router now sets "router" as default service name in Opentelemetry traces, that can be replaced using the configuration file or environment variables. It also sets the key "process.executable_name".

### Accept an endpoint URL without scheme for telemetry [PR #964](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/964)

Endpoint configuration for Datadog and OTLP take a URL as argument, but was incorrectly recognizing addresses of the format "host:port"
