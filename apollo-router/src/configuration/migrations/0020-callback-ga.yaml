    log: "'subscription.mode.preview_callback' has transitioned from preview to general availability (GA) and has been renamed to 'subscription.mode.callback'. The 'public_url' configuration must also include the configured 'path'.\n\n The GA version of the callback protocol is not backward compatible with the preview version.\n\n Please upgrade your subgraph implementation.
