In this tutorial we will have a look at how to clone the router repository and build it from the sources.

### Prerequisites

If you would like to compile the binary yourself, you will need:

- Git: Github provides a tutorial on how to [install git on your machine](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- Rust: Head over to [the rustup website](https://rustup.rs/) to install rust

### Git clone

‚ö†Ô∏è This project uses submodules. Make sure your submodules are initialized and up to date!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apollographql/router.git
cd router
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Environment setup

This tutorial will only require one port on your machine:

- 4000: The Apollo federation router

You should be good to go!

## Building and running the Apollo federation router

In this project's root directory, you can run the following command to build and run the Apollo federation router:

```bash
ignition@ignition-apollo router % cargo run -- --supergraph ./examples/supergraph.graphql
   Compiling router-bridge v0.1.0 (https://github.com/apollographql/federation.git)
   Compiling apollo-router-core v0.1.0-prealpha.3 (/Users/ignition/projects/apollo/router/crates/apollo-router-core)
   Compiling apollo-router v0.1.0-prealpha.3 (/Users/ignition/projects/apollo/router/crates/apollo-router)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 5.38s
     Running `target/debug/router -p ./examples/hello-world`
Nov 02 17:08:09.926  INFO router: Starting Apollo Router
Nov 02 17:08:10.279  INFO router: Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4000 üöÄ
```

Go to http://127.0.0.1:4000 to open the [Apollo studio explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/) and inspect the graph, and run your first queries using the Apollo federation router!
