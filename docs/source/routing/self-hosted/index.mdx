A self-hosted GraphOS Router or Apollo Router Core enables you to fully manage the runtime infrastructure and deployments of your supergraph.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["<b>Router</b>"]);
  serviceB[Products<br/>API];
  serviceC[Reviews<br/>API];
  router -->|Sub-query| serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.->|Query| router;
  class clients secondary;
```

<Note>

Self-hosting the GraphOS Router requires a current GraphOS [Enterprise or Free plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing).

</Note>

## Downloading and installing a self-hosted router

Apollo provides the router as both a binary and as images to run in your containerized deployments.

### Router binary
=======
For each version of the Apollo Router, Apollo provides:

- [A Helm chart for Kubernetes](#kubernetes-using-helm)
- [A binary](#local-binary)
- [A Docker image](#container)

## Kubernetes Using Helm
>>>>>>> 20aaf5a1 (draft: changes to the kubernetes docs)

Apollo provides a binary of the router for multiple platforms. You can download the router bundle, extract the router binary, and run it. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
To learn more, follow the steps in the [self-hosted router installation](/graphos/reference/router/self-hosted-install) reference to run a router binary with a sample supergraph schema.

### Router container image

Apollo provides container images of the router to deploy in self-hosted environments. The router images are hosted on GitHub in its container repository. Each router release includes both production and debug images. 

To learn more, go to the [containerization overview](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization).

- If running with Docker, go to the [Docker](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker) docs to learn how to run router images.
- If running with Kubernetes, go to the [Kubernetes](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/kubernetes) docs to learn to deploy with router Helm charts.

## Next steps

- To prepare your routers for production deployment, follow the guides in [Production Readiness](/graphos/platform/production-readiness/checklist) docs.
=======
Follow the [Kubernetes quickstart](/graphos/routing/kubernetes/quickstart) to deploy the router with a Helm chart.

## Docker

Apollo provides Docker images with each release of Apollo Router. The images are available via GitHub, downloadable from the `ghcr.io/apollographql/router` and the [router repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/router). Both debug and production images are provided.

For more information on deploying using your container environment:

- [Docker](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker)
- [AWS using Elastic Container Service (ECS)](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/aws)
- [Azure using Azure Container App](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/azure)
- [GCP using Google Cloud Run](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/gcp)

## Local binary

Running the Apollo Router directly from its binary speeds up local development, and it enables embedded use cases where containers are unavailable. 

Follow the [quickstart](/graphos/routing/get-started) to run a router binary.
