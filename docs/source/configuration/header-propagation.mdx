title: Sending HTTP headers to subgraphs
description: Configure which headers the Apollo Router sends to which subgraphs
---

You can configure which HTTP headers the Apollo Router includes in its requests to each of your subgraphs. You can define per-subgraph header rules, along with rules that apply to _all_ subgraphs.

You define header rules in your [YAML configuration file](./overview/#yaml-config-file), like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
# ...other configuration...
headers:
  all: # Header rules for all subgraphs
    - propagate:
        matching: ^upstream-header-.*
    - remove:
        named: "x-legacy-account-id"
  subgraphs:
    products: # Header rules for just the products subgraph
    - insert:
        name: "router-subgraph-name"
        value: "products"

```

## Supported header rules

The Apollo Router supports the following types of header rules:

### `propagate`

Enables you to selectively pass along headers that were included in the client's request to the router.

You can specify which headers to propagate based on a matching [regex pattern](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/):

```yaml
- propagate:
    matching: .*
```
> **Note:** The Apollo Router _never_ propagates so-called [hop-by-hop headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#hop-by-hop_headers) (such as `Content-Length`) when propagating by pattern.


Alternatively, you can provide a static string via the `named` option. These `named` configurations have additional flexibility, because they support the following options:

- `default`: A value to set if _no_ value was sent by the client
- `rename`: Renames the header's key to the provided value

```yaml
- propagate:
      named: "x-user-id"
      default: "abc123"
      rename: "account-id"
```

### `remove`

Enables you to selectively remove headers that were included in the client's request to the router. Like [`propagate`](#propagate), this option can match either a static string or a [regular expression](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/).

```yaml
# Do not send this subgraph the "Cookie" header.
- remove:
    named: "Cookie"
- remove:
    # Remove headers that include the legacy 'x-' prefix.
    matching: ^x-.*$
```

### `insert`

Enables you to add custom headers to requests going to a specific subgraph. These headers are always static strings that originate in the router, instead of originating in the client.

```yaml
- insert:
    name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router"
    value: "indeed"
```

## Rule ordering

Header rules are applied in the same order they're declared, and later rules can _override_ the effects of earlier rules. Consider this example:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">❌</p>

```yaml title="bad_configuration.yaml"
headers:
all:
  - remove:
    named: "test"
  - propagate:
    matching: .*
```

In this example, first any header named `test` is removed from the list of headers to propagate. However, _the list of headers to propagate is currently empty!_ Next, the `propagate` rule adds _all_ headers to the propagation list, _including_ `test`.

To correctly remove a header from the propagation list, make sure to define your `remove` rule _after_ any `propagate` rules:

<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">✅</p>

```yaml title="good_configuration.yaml"
headers:
all:
  - propagate:
    matching: .*
  - remove:
    named: "test"
```

With this ordering, first all headers are added to the propagation list, then the `test` header is removed.

## Example

Here's a complete example showing all the possible configuration options in use:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
headers:
  # Header rules for all subgraphs
  all:
  # Propagate matching headers
  - propagate:
      matching: ^upstream-header-.*
  # Propagate matching headers
  - propagate:
      named: "some-header"
      default: "default-value"
      rename: "destination-header"
  # Remove the "x-legacy-account-id" header
  - remove:
      named: "x-legacy-account-id"
  # Remove matching headers
  - remove:
      matching: ^x-deprecated-.*
  # Insert the 'my-company' header
  - insert:
      name: "my-company"
      value: "acme"
  # Subgraph-specific header rules
  subgraphs:
    products:
      # Calls to the products subgraph have the "router-subgraph-name" header set to `products`.
      - insert:
          name: "router-subgraph-name"
          value: "products"
    accounts:
      # Calls to the accounts subgraph have the "router-subgraph-name" header set to `accounts`.
      - insert:
          name: "router-subgraph-name"
          value: "accounts"
```
