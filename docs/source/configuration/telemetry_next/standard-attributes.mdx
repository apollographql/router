## Open Telemetry Standard attributes

[Open Telemetry semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/) define a set of standard attributes 
that can be attached to [spans](spans.mdx), [instruments](instruments.mdx) and [events](events.mdx). These attributes are used to filter and group data in your APM.

The attributes available depend on the stage of the Router pipeline.

Here is an example of a standard attribute on the router span:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  spans:
    router:
      attributes:
        # Standard attributes
        http.response.status_code: true
```

### Configuration reference 

#### Router
This Router stage is the initial entrypoint for all requests. It is HTTP centric and deals with bytes.

Note that: `http.request.header.<key>` and `http.response.header.<key>` are not available as standard attributes, bu can be configured using a custom attribute.

For instance, to configure an attribute for `x-my-header` on router spans:
```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  spans:
    router:
      attributes:
        "http.request.header.x-my-header":
          request_header: "x-my-header"
```

#### Supergraph
The Supergraph stage is executed after query parse but before query execution. It is Graphql centric and deals with GraphQL queries and responses.

| Attribute                   | Value                               | Description                                 |

| `graphql.operation.name`    |                                     | The operation name from the graphql query   |
| `graphql.operation.type`    | `query`\|`mutation`\|`subscription` | The operation kind from the subgraph query  |
| `graphql.document`          |                                     | The graphql query to the subgraph           |


#### Subgraph
The subgraph stage executed multiple times during query execution each representing a call to a single subgraph.
It is Graphql centric and deals with GraphQL queries and responses.

| Attribute                          | Value                               | Description                                    |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|

| `subgraph.graphql.operation.name`  |                                     | The operation name from the subgraph query     |
| `subgraph.graphql.operation.type`  | `query`\|`mutation`\|`subscription` | The operation kind from the subgraph query     |
| `subgraph.graphql.document`        |                                     | The graphql query to the subgraph              |
