By default, the Apollo Router collects some anonymous usage data to help us improve the product.

**To opt out of data collection,** set the `APOLLO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` environment variable to `1` in each environment where you run the Apollo Router.

> The Apollo Router doesn't collect _any_ personally identifiable information (such as API keys, graph names, or file paths). For more information on how Apollo collects and uses this data, see [our privacy policy](https://www.apollographql.com/Apollo-Privacy-Policy.pdf).

## Collected data

Unless you opt out, the Apollo Router reports the following data:

- The execution command that was run _(excluding any identifiable arguments such as file-system paths or profile names)_
- The version of `router` that was executed
- The configuration properties which have been referenced, but limited to types which could not contain personally identifiable information (e.g., certain scalar types; a property which is set to `true` not the value if it is a `string`)
- A unique, anonymized **machine identifier**, which is the same for every command run on the same machine
- A unique, anonymized **session identifier**, which is different for every command
- The SHA-256 hash of the directory that `router` was executed from
- The SHA-256 hash of the contents of the supergraph schema
- The operating system `router` was executed on
- The CI system `router` was executed on, if any
