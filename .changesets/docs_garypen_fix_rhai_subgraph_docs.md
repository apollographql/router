### Rhai documentation: remove incorrect statement about request.subgraph fields ([PR #3808](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3808))

It is possible to modify `request.subgraph` fields from a Rhai script, which is now correctly reflected in [Rhai documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/rhai-api/#request-interface).
