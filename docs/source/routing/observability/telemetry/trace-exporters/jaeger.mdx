This tracing exporter is a configuration of the [OTLP exporter](/graphos/routing/observability/telemetry/trace-exporters/otlp) to use with [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/).

For general tracing configuration, refer to [Router Tracing Configuration](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/tracing/overview).

## Jaeger OTLP configuration

Since Jaeger v1.35.0, [Jaeger supports native OTLP ingestion](https://medium.com/jaegertracing/introducing-native-support-for-opentelemetry-in-jaeger-eb661be8183c), and it's the recommended way to send traces to Jaeger.

When running Jaeger with Docker, make sure that port **4317** is exposed and that `COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED` is set to `true`. For example:

```bash
docker run --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.35
```

To configure the router to send traces via OTLP, set the Jaeger endpoint with port 4317. For example:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    tracing:
      propagation:
          # Important! You must enable Jaeger propagation to use allow use of Jaeger headers for traceIDs.
          jaeger: true
      otlp:
        enabled: true
        # Optional endpoint, either 'default' or a URL (Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:4317)
        endpoint: "http://${env.JAEGER_HOST}:4317"
```

See [OTLP configuration](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/tracing/otlp#configuration) for more details on settings.
