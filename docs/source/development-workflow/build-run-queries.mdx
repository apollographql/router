## Apollo Sandbox

The landing page above provides a link to [Apollo Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox), a powerful web IDE that enables you to build and run operations against your router. Sandbox is a special instance of the [Apollo Studio Explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/) that doesn't require an Apollo account.
