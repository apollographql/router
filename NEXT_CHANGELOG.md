### Apollo uplink: Configurable schema poll timeout ([PR #2271](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2271))

In addition to the url and poll interval, Uplink poll timeout can now be configured via command line arg and env variable:

```bash
        --apollo-uplink-timeout <APOLLO_UPLINK_TIMEOUT>
            The timeout for each of the polls to Apollo Uplink. [env: APOLLO_UPLINK_TIMEOUT=] [default: 30s]
```

It defaults to 30 seconds.

## 🐛 Fixes

### Return an error on duplicate keys in configuration ([Issue #1428](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1428))

If you have duplicated keys in your yaml configuration like this:

```yaml
telemetry:
  tracing:
    propagation:
      jaeger: true
  tracing:
    propagation:
      jaeger: false
```

It will now throw an error on router startup:

`ERROR duplicated keys detected in your yaml configuration: 'telemetry.tracing'`
