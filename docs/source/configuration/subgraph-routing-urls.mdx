title: Configuring runtime subgraph routing URLs.
description: Overriding the default subgraph URLs used during query plan execution.

import { Link } from 'gatsby';

By default, the router uses subgraph URLs defined in the schema so there is no further configuration needed.
But when you need to override those addresses locally, you can do that in your [YAML configuration file](#configuration-file).

This will override the URL for the accounts subgraph:

```yaml
override_subgraph_url:
  accounts: http://localhost:8080
```
