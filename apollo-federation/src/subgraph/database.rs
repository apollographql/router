//! Valid federation 2 subgraphs.
//!
//! Note: technically, federation 1 subgraphs are still accepted as input of
//! composition. However, there is some pre-composition steps that "massage"
//! the input schema to transform them in fully valid federation 2 subgraphs,
//! so the subgraphs seen by composition and query planning are always fully
//! valid federation 2 ones, and this is what this database handles.
//! Note2: This does assumes that whichever way an implementation of this
//! trait is created, some validation that the underlying schema is a valid
//! federation subgraph (so valid graphql, link to the federation spec, and
//! pass additional federation validations). If this is not the case, most
//! of the methods here will panic.
