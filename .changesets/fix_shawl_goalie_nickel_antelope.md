### Certain query patterns may cause resource exhaustion

Corrects a set of denial-of-service (DOS) vulnerabilities that made it possible for an attacker to render router inoperable with certain simple query patterns due to uncontrolled resource consumption. All prior-released versions and configurations are vulnerable except those where `persisted_queries.enabled`, `persisted_queries.safelist.enabled`, and `persisted_queries.safelist.require_id` are all `true`.
