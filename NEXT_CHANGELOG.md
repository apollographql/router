## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó
## üöÄ Features

### Add `trace_id` in logs to identify all logs related to a specific request [Issue #1981](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1981))

It automatically adds a `trace_id` on logs to identify which log is related to a specific request. Also adds `apollo_trace_id` in response headers to help the client to identify logs for this request.

Example of logs in text:

```logs
2022-10-21T15:17:45.562553Z ERROR [trace_id=5e6a6bda8d0dca26e5aec14dafa6d96f] apollo_router::services::subgraph_service: fetch_error="hyper::Error(Connect, ConnectError(\"tcp connect error\", Os { code: 111, kind: ConnectionRefused, message: \"Connection refused\" }))"
