Apollo provides container images of the Apollo Router Core that you can self-host and run with GraphOS as GraphOS Routers. By containerizing the router, you can run it in a cluster and leverage the portability, scalability, and high availability benefits of containerization. Containers can also simplify and speed up local development.

## Docker

### Apollo Runtime container (Recommended)

Apollo provides combined Docker images containing the Apollo Router and MCP Server for easy deployment. The images are available via GitHub, downloadable from the [registry](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-runtime/pkgs/container/apollo-runtime) and the [repository](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-runtime).

For more information on deploying using your container environment:

- [Docker](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker)

### Router only container

This image is recommended only for Kubernetes-based deployments, and is used by the [Helm chart](/router/containerization/kubernetes/). For more information on deploying using your container environment:

- [Docker](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/docker-router-only)
- [AWS using Elastic Container Service (ECS)](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/aws)
- [Azure using Azure Container Apps](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/azure)
- [GCP using Google Cloud Run](/graphos/routing/self-hosted/containerization/gcp)
- [Kubernetes](/router/containerization/kubernetes/)
