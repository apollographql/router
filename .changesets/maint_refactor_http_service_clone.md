### Fix HTTP client service handling to prevent connection issues ([PR #7694](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/7694))

Fixed an issue where the router's HTTP client service was not properly managing connections, which could lead to degraded performance or connection problems when making requests to subgraph services. The router now correctly handles service reuse and maintains proper flow control.
