## 🐛 Fixes

### Support introspection object types ([PR #1240](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1240))

Introspection queries can use a set of object types defined in the specification. The query parsing code was not recognizing them,
resulting in some introspection queries not working.

## 🛠 Maintenance
## 📚 Documentation

### Update README link to the configuration file  ([PR #1208](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1208))

As the structure of the documentation has changed, the link should point to the `YAML config file` section of the overview.
