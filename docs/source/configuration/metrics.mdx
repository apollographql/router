title: Collecting metrics in the Apollo Router
---

The Apollo Router provides built-in support for metrics collection via [Prometheus](#using-prometheus) and [OpenTelemetry Collector](#using-opentelemetry-collector).

## Common configuration

### Service name

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      # (Optional) Set the service name to easily find metrics related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
      service_name: "router"
```

Service name discovery is handled in the following order:
1. `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` env
2. `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` env
3. `router.yaml` `service_name`
4. `router.yaml` `resource`

If none of the above are found then the service name will be set to `unknown_service:apollo_router` or `unknown_service` if the executable name cannot be determined.

### Resource

A Resource is a set of key-value pairs that provide additional information to an exporter. APMs may interpret and display resource information. 

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      resource:
        "environment.name": "production"
        "environment.namespace": "{env.MY_K8_NAMESPACE_ENV_VARIABLE}"
```

> [See OpenTelemetry conventions for resources.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/README.md)

## Using Prometheus

You can use [Prometheus and Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) to collect metrics and visualize the router metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      # By setting this endpoint you enable the Prometheus exporter
      # All our endpoints exposed by plugins are namespaced by the name of the plugin
      enabled: true
      listen: 127.0.0.1:9090
      path: /metrics
```

### Using in a containers environment

The Prometheus endpoint listens to 127.0.0.1 by default, which won't allow connections issued from a network.
While this is a safe default, _other containers won't be able to access the Prometheus endpoint_, which will disable metric scraping.

You can change this by setting:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      # By setting this endpoint you enable other containers and pods to access the Prometheus endpoint
      enabled: true
      listen: 0.0.0.0:9090
      path: /metrics
```

Assuming you're running locally:

1. Run a query against the router.
2. Navigate to [http://localhost:9090/metrics](http://localhost:9090/metrics) to see something like:

```
# HELP apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds Total number of HTTP requests made.
# TYPE apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds histogram
apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"} 1
apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.9"} 1
---SNIP---
```

> Note that if you haven't run a query against the router yet, you'll see a blank page because no metrics have been generated!

## Datadog via OTLP

To use Datadog, you must configure the Datadog agent to accept OTLP metrics. This can be done by adding the following to your `datadog.yaml`:

```yaml title="datadog.yaml"
otlp_config:
  receiver:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: <dd-agent-ip>:4317
```

The router must also be configured to send traces to the Datadog agent:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    otlp:
      enabled: true
      # Temporality MUST be set to delta. Failure to do this will result in incorrect metrics.
      temporality: delta
      # Optional endpoint, either 'default' or a URL (Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:4317)
      endpoint: "${env.DATADOG_AGENT_HOST}:4317"
```

See [Datadog Agent configuration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/otlp_ingest_in_the_agent/?tab=host) for more details

## Available metrics

The following metrics are available for Prometheus and OpenTelemetry. Attributes are listed where applicable.

### HTTP

- `apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket` - HTTP router request duration
- `apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket` - HTTP subgraph request duration, attributes:
  - `subgraph`: (Optional) The subgraph being queried
- `apollo_router_http_requests_total` - Total number of HTTP requests by HTTP status
- `apollo_router_timeout` - Number of triggered timeouts
- `apollo_router_http_request_retry_total` - Number of subgraph requests retried, attributes:
  - `subgraph`: The subgraph being queried
  - `status` : If the retry was aborted (`aborted`)

### Session

- `apollo_router_session_count_total` - Number of currently connected clients
- `apollo_router_session_count_active` - Number of in-flight GraphQL requests

### Cache

- `apollo_router_cache_size` â€” Number of entries in the cache
- `apollo_router_cache_hit_count` - Number of cache hits
- `apollo_router_cache_miss_count` - Number of cache misses
- `apollo_router_cache_hit_time` - Time to hit the cache in seconds
- `apollo_router_cache_miss_time` - Time to miss the cache in seconds

All cache metrics listed above have the following attributes:

- `kind`: the cache being queried (`apq`, `query planner`, `introspection`)
- `storage`: The backend storage of the cache (`memory`, `redis`)

### Coprocessor

- `apollo_router_operations_coprocessor_total` - Total operations with coprocessors enabled.
- `apollo_router_operations_coprocessor.duration` - Time spent waiting for the coprocessor to answer, in seconds.

The coprocessor operations metric has the following attributes:

- `coprocessor.stage`: string (`RouterRequest`, `RouterResponse`, `SubgraphRequest`, `SubgraphResponse`)
- `coprocessor.succeeded`: bool

### Performance

- `apollo_router_processing_time` - Time spent processing a request (outside of waiting for external or subgraph requests) in seconds.
- `apollo_router_query_planning_time` - Time spent planning queries in seconds.
- `apollo_router_query_planning_warmup_duration` - Time spent planning queries in seconds.
- `apollo_router_schema_load_duration` - Time spent loading the schema in seconds.

### Uplink

- `apollo_router_uplink_fetch_duration_seconds_bucket` - Uplink request duration, attributes:

  - `url`: The Uplink URL that was polled
  - `query`: The query that the router sent to Uplink (`SupergraphSdl` or `License`)
  - `kind`: (`new`, `unchanged`, `http_error`, `uplink_error`)
  - `code`: The error code depending on type (if an error occurred)
  - `error`: The error message (if an error occurred)

- `apollo_router_uplink_fetch_count_total`
  - `status`: (`success`, `failure`)
  - `query`: The query that the router sent to Uplink (`SupergraphSdl` or `License`)

Note that the initial call to uplink during router startup will not be reflected in metrics.

### Subscription

- `apollo_router_opened_subscriptions` - Number of different opened subscriptions (not the number of clients with an opened subscriptions in case it's deduplicated)
- `apollo_router_deduplicated_subscriptions_total` - Number of subscriptions that has been deduplicated
- `apollo_router_skipped_event_count` - Number of subscription events that has been skipped because too many events have been received from the subgraph but not yet sent to the client.

### Batching

- `apollo_router.operations.batching` - A counter of the number of query batches received by the router.
- `apollo_router.operations.batching.size` - A histogram tracking the number of queries contained within a query batch.

## Using OpenTelemetry Collector

You can send metrics to [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) for processing and reporting metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    otlp:
      # Enable the OpenTelemetry exporter
      enabled: true

      # Optional endpoint, either 'default' or a URL (Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:4317 for gRPC and http://127.0.0.1:4318 for HTTP)
      endpoint: default

      # Optional protocol. Only grpc is supported currently.
      # Setting to http will result in configuration failure.
      protocol: grpc

      # Optional Grpc configuration
      grpc:
        domain_name: "my.domain"
        key: ""
        ca: ""
        cert: ""
        metadata:
          foo: bar

      # Optional batch_processor configuration
      batch_processor:
        scheduled_delay: 100ms
        max_concurrent_exports: 1000
        max_export_batch_size: 10000
        max_export_timeout: 100s
        max_queue_size: 10000
```

Remember that `file.` and `env.` prefixes can be used for expansion in config yaml. e.g. `${file.ca.txt}`.

## Adding custom attributes/labels

You can add custom attributes (OpenTelemetry) and labels (Prometheus) to your generated metrics. You can apply these across _all_ requests, or you can selectively apply them based on the details of a particular request. These details include:

- The presence of a particular HTTP header
- The value at a particular JSON path within a request or response body (either from a subgraph or from the router itself)
  - [See examples of querying a JSON path.](#example-json-path-queries)
- A custom value provided via the router plugin context

Examples of all of these are shown in the file below:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      attributes:
        supergraph: # Attribute configuration for requests to/responses from the router
          static:
            - name: "version"
              value: "v1.0.0"
          request:
            header:
              - named: "content-type"
                rename: "payload_type"
                default: "application/json"
              - named: "x-custom-header-to-add"
          response:
            body:
              # Apply the value of the provided path of the router's response body as an attribute
              - path: .errors[0].extensions.http.status
                name: error_from_body
              # Use the unique extension code to identify the kind of error
              - path: .errors[0].extensions.code
                name: error_code
          context:
            # Apply the indicated element from the plugin chain's context as an attribute
            - named: my_key
        subgraph: # Attribute configuration for requests to/responses from subgraphs
          all:
            static:
              # Always apply this attribute to all metrics for all subgraphs
              - name: kind
                value: subgraph_request
            errors: # Only work if it's a valid GraphQL error (for example if the subgraph returns an http error or if the router can't reach the subgraph)
              include_messages: true # Will include the error message in a message attribute
              extensions: # Include extensions data
                - name: subgraph_error_extended_type # Name of the attribute
                  path: .type # JSON query path to fetch data from extensions
                - name: message
                  path: .reason
            # Will create this kind of metric for example apollo_router_http_requests_error_total{message="cannot contact the subgraph",subgraph="my_subgraph_name",subgraph_error_extended_type="SubrequestHttpError"}
          subgraphs:
            my_subgraph_name: # Apply these rules only for the subgraph named `my_subgraph_name`
              request:
                header:
                  - named: "x-custom-header"
                body:
                  # Apply the value of the provided path of the router's request body as an attribute (here it's the query)
                  - path: .query
                    name: query
                    default: UNKNOWN
```

### Example JSON path queries

Let's say you have a JSON request body with the following structure:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "unwanted": 7,
      "wanted": { "x": 3, "y": 7 },
      "array": [3, 2, 1]
    },
    {
      "isImportant": true
    }
  ]
}
```

To fetch the value of the field `isImportant`, the corresponding path is `.items[1].isImportant`.

To fetch the value of the field `x`, the corresponding path is `.items[0].wanted.x`.

JSON path queries always begin with a period `.`

## Changing default buckets for histograms

You can customize the buckets for all generated histograms:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      buckets:
        - 0.05
        - 0.10
        - 0.25
        - 0.50
        - 1.00
        - 2.50
        - 5.00
        - 10.00
        - 20.00
```
