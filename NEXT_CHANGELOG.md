## 🚀 Features

### Apollo uplink: Configurable schema poll timeout ([PR #2271](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2271))

In addition to the url and poll interval, Uplink poll timeout can now be configured via command line arg and env variable:

```bash
        --apollo-uplink-timeout <APOLLO_UPLINK_TIMEOUT>
            The timeout for each of the polls to Apollo Uplink. [env: APOLLO_UPLINK_TIMEOUT=] [default: 30s]
```

It defaults to 30 seconds.
