## üêõ Fixes ( :bug: )

### Support introspection object types ([PR #1240](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1240))

Introspection queries can use a set of object types defined in the specification. The query parsing code was not recognizing them,
resulting in some introspection queries not working.
