### Add new attributes to the Supergraph Selector Query attribute ([PR #5433](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/5433))

Adds support for four new attributes for the supergraph Query instrument:
 - aliases (the number of aliases in the query)
 - depth (the depth of the query)
 - height (the height of the query)
 - root_fields (the number of root_fields in the query)

You can use this data to understand how your graph is used and to help determine where to set limits, if desired.

For example:

```
instruments:
  supergraph:
    'query.depth':
      description: 'The depth of the query'
      value:
        query: depth
      unit: unit
      type: histogram
```
