<Caution>

Apollo is discontinuing Serverless and Dedicated plans, which use cloud routers. Cloud routers will no longer be available after [TODO SUNSET DATE].

<br/><br/>

If you're currently on a Serverless or Dedicated plan, migrate your graphs to use self-hosted routers. [See the migration guide](/graphos/routing/cloud/migrate-to-self-hosted) for step-by-step instructions.

</Caution>
