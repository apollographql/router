title: Tracing in the Apollo Router
description: Collect tracing information

import { Link } from "gatsby";

The Apollo Router supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), with exporters for:

* [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)
* [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/)
* [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
* [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md) over HTTP or gRPC

The Apollo Router generates spans that include the various phases of serving a request and associated dependencies. This is useful for showing how response time is affected by:

* Sub-request response times
* Query shape (sub-request dependencies)
* Apollo Router post-processing

Span data is sent to a collector such as [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), which can assemble spans into a gantt chart for analysis.

> To get the most out of distributed tracing, _all_ components in your system should be instrumented.

## Common configuration

### Service name

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    common:
      # (Optional) Set the service name to easily find traces related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
      service_name: "router"
```

Service name discovery is handled in the following order:
1. `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` env
2. `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` env
3. `router.yaml` `service_name`
4. `router.yaml` `resource`

If none of the above are found then the service name will be set to `unknown_service:apollo_router` or `unknown_service` if the executable name cannot be determined.

### Resource

A Resource is a set of key-value pairs that provide additional global information exported with your traces.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    common:
      resource:
        "environment.name": "production"
        "environment.namespace": "{env.MY_K8_NAMESPACE_ENV_VARIABLE}"
```

> [See OpenTelemetry conventions for resources.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/README.md)

### Sampling

To prevent sending to many traces to your APM you may want to enable sampling. 

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    common:
      sampler: always_on # (default) all requests are sampled (always_on|always_off|<0.0-1.0>)
      parent_based_sampler: true # (default) If an incoming span has OpenTelemetry headers then the request will always be sampled. 
```

Setting `sampler` to `0.1` will result in only 10% of your requests being sampled.

`parent_based_sampler` enables clients to make the sampling decision. This guarantees that a trace that starts at a client will also have spans at the router. You may wish to turn this off if your router is exposed directly to the internet. 

### Propagation

The `propagation` section allows you to configure which propagators are active in addition to those automatically activated by using an exporter.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    propagation:
      # https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/
      baggage: false

      # https://www.datadoghq.com/
      datadog: false

      # https://www.jaegertracing.io/ (compliant with opentracing)
      jaeger: false

      # https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/
      trace_context: false

      # https://zipkin.io/ (compliant with opentracing)
      zipkin: false

      # https://aws.amazon.com/xray/ (compliant with opentracing)
      aws_xray: false

      # If you have your own way to generate a trace id and you want to pass it via a custom request header
      request:
        header_name: my-trace-id
```

Specifying explicit propagation is generally only required if you're using an exporter that supports multiple trace ID formats (e.g., OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, or OpenTracing compatible exporters).

### Span limits

You may set limits on spans to prevent sending too much data to your APM.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    common:

      # Optional limits
      max_attributes_per_event: 10
      max_attributes_per_link: 10
      max_attributes_per_span: 10
      max_events_per_span: 10
      max_links_per_span: 10
```

## Trace ID

> This is part of an experimental feature, it means any time until it's stabilized (without the prefix `experimental_`) we might change the configuration shape or adding/removing features.
> If you want to give feedback or participate in that feature feel free to join [this discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/2147).

If you want to expose in response headers the generated trace ID or the one you provided using propagation headers you can use this configuration:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    experimental_response_trace_id:
      enabled: true # default: false
      header_name: "my-trace-id" # default: "apollo-trace-id"
```

Using this configuration you will have a response header called `my-trace-id` containing the trace ID. It could help you to debug a specific query if you want to grep your log with this trace id to have more context.

## Batch Processor

All trace exporters (apollo|datadog|zipkin|jaeger|otlp) have batch span processor configuration, it will be necessary to tune this if you see the following in your logs:

`OpenTelemetry trace error occurred: cannot send span to the batch span processor because the channel is full`

* **scheduled_delay** The delay from receiving the first span to the batch being sent.
* **max_concurrent_exports** The maximum number of overlapping export requests. For instance if ingest is taking a long time to respond there may be several overlapping export requests.
* **max_export_batch_size** The number of spans to include in a batch. Your ingest may have max message size limits.
* **max_export_timeout** The timeout for sending spans before dropping the data.
* **max_queue_size** The maximum number of spans to be buffered before dropping span data.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  # Apollo tracing
  apollo:
    batch_processor:
      scheduled_delay: 100ms
      max_concurrent_exports: 1000
      max_export_batch_size: 10000
      max_export_timeout: 100s
      max_queue_size: 10000

  tracing:
    # Datadog
    datadog:
      enabled: true
      batch_processor:
        scheduled_delay: 100ms
        max_concurrent_exports: 1000
        max_export_batch_size: 10000
        max_export_timeout: 100s
        max_queue_size: 10000
      endpoint: default
    # Jaeger
    # Otlp
    # Zipkin
```

You will need to experiment to find the setting that are appropriate for your use case.

## Using Datadog (native)

The Apollo Router can be configured to connect to either the default agent address or a URL.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    datadog:
      enabled: true
      # Optional endpoint, either 'default' or a URL (Defaults to http://localhost:8126/v0.4/traces)
      endpoint: "http://${env.DATADOG_AGENT_HOST}:8126/v0.4/traces"
```

[Given that there are some incompatibilities](https://docs.rs/opentelemetry-datadog/latest/opentelemetry_datadog/#quirks)
between Datadog and OpenTelemetry, the DataDog exporter might not provide meaningful contextual information in the exported spans.
To fix this, you can configure the Apollo Router to perform a mapping for the span name and the span resource name.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    datadog:
      enabled: true
      enable_span_mapping: true
```

when `enable_span_mapping` is set to `true`, the Apollo Router will perform the following mapping:

1. Use the Open Telemetry span name to set the Data Dog span operation name.
2. Use the Open Telemetry span attributes to set the DataDog span resource name.

Example:

Lets say we send a query `MyQuery` to the Apollo Router, then the Router using the operation's query plan will send a
query to `my-subgraph-name` and the following trace will be created:

```
    | apollo_router request                                                                 |
        | apollo_router router                                                              |
            | apollo_router supergraph                                                      |
            | apollo_router query_planning  | apollo_router execution                       |
                                                | apollo_router fetch                       |
                                                    | apollo_router subgraph                |
                                                        | apollo_router subgraph_request    |
```

As you can see, there is no clear information about the name of the query, the name of the subgraph, and the name of the
query sent to the subgraph.

Instead when `enable_span_mapping` is set to `true` the following trace will be created:

```
    | request /graphql                                                                                   |
        | router                                                                                         |
            | supergraph MyQuery                                                                         |
                | query_planning MyQuery  | execution                                                    |
                                              | fetch fetch                                              |
                                                  | subgraph my-subgraph-name                            |
                                                      | subgraph_request MyQuery__my-subgraph-name__0    |
```


## Using Jaeger (native)

> :warning: [Jaeger native is deprecated](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2022/jaeger-native-otlp/) and will be removed in a future release of the Apollo Router. Instead, [OTLP](#jaeger) should be used.

The Apollo Router can be configured to export tracing data to Jaeger either via an agent or http collector.

Unless explicitly configured to use a collector, Jaeger will use an agent by default.

### Agent config

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    jaeger:
      enabled: true
      # Optional agent configuration,
      agent:
        # Optional endpoint, either 'default' or a socket address (Defaults to 127.0.0.1:6832)
        endpoint: "${env.JAEGER_HOST}:6832"  
```

### Collector config

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    jaeger:
      enabled: true
      # Optional collector configuration,
      collector:
        # Optional endpoint, either 'default' or a URL (Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:14268/api/traces)
        endpoint: "http://${env.JAEGER_HOST}:14268/api/traces"
        username: "${env.JAEGER_USERNAME}"
        password: "${env.JAEGER_PASSWORD}"
```

## OTLP

OTLP (OpenTelemetry protocol) is the native protocol for open telemetry. It can be used to export traces to a variety of backends including:
* OpenTelemetry Collector
* Datadog
* Honeycomb
* Lightstep

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    otlp:
      enabled: true
      
      # Optional endpoint, either 'default' or a URL (Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:4317 for gRPC and http://127.0.0.1:4318 for HTTP)
      endpoint: default

      # Optional protocol (Defaults to grpc)
      protocol: grpc

      # Optional Grpc configuration
      grpc:
        domain_name: "my.domain"
        key: ""
        ca: ""
        cert: ""
        metadata:
          foo: bar

      # Optional Http configuration
      http:
        headers:
          foo: bar
```

Remember that `file.` and `env.` prefixes can be used for expansion in config yaml. e.g. `${file.ca.txt}`.

### Datadog

To use Datadog, you must configure the Datadog agent to accept OTLP traces. This can be done by adding the following to your `datadog.yaml`:

```yaml title="datadog.yaml"
otlp_config:
  receiver:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: <dd-agent-ip>:4317
```

The router must also be configured to send traces to the Datadog agent:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    otlp:
      enabled: true

      # Optional endpoint, either 'default' or a URL (Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:4317)
      endpoint: "${env.DATADOG_AGENT_HOST}:4317"
```

See [Datadog Agent configuration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/otlp_ingest_in_the_agent/?tab=host) for more details 

### Jaeger

Since 1.35.0, [Jaeger supports native OTLP ingestion](https://medium.com/jaegertracing/introducing-native-support-for-opentelemetry-in-jaeger-eb661be8183c).

Ensure that when running Jaeger in docker port 4317 is exposed and that `COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED` is set to `true`:
```bash
docker run --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.35
```

Then configure the router to send traces via OTLP:
```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    otlp:
      enabled: true

      # Optional endpoint, either 'default' or a URL (Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:4317)
      endpoint: "http://${env.JAEGER_HOST}:4317"
```

## Using Zipkin

The Apollo Router can be configured to export tracing data to either the default collector address or a URL:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    zipkin:
      enabled: true

      # Optional endpoint, either 'default' or a URL (Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:9411/api/v2/spans)
      endpoint: "http://${env.ZIPKIN_HOST}:9411/api/v2/spans}"   
```
