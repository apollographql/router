# [0.14.1] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### CORS: Mirror client's requested headers by default ([PR #1480](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1480))

The router now mirrors client's `Access-Control-Request-Headers` by default.

#### What has changed?
The latest release (0.14.0) introduced an `allow_any_header` setting, which is now removed.
#### How do I `allow_any_header` in the latest release?
This is the default behavior, you can remove `allow_any_header` from your configuration.

#### How do I *not* `allow_any_header` in the latest release?
You can provide a list of headers to allow by filling the `allow_headers` key:
```yaml title="router.yaml"
server:
  cors:
    allow_any_origin: true
    allow_headers:
      - Content-Type
      - Authorization
      - x-my-custom-header
```

### Reference-counting for the schema string given to plugins ([PR #???](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/))

The type of the `supergraph_sdl` field of the `apollo_router::plugin::PluginInit` struct
was changed from `String` to `Arc<String>`.
This reduces the number of copies of this string we keep in memory, as schemas can get large.

### Configuration handling enhancements ([PR #1454](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1454))

* Allows completely empty configuration without error.
* Prevents unknown tags at the root of the configuration from being silently ignored.

### CORS: Fix trailing slashes, and display defaults ([PR #1471](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1471))

The CORS documentation now displays a valid `origins` configuration (without trailing slash!), and the full configuration section displays its default settings.
