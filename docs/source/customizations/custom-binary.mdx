title: Creating a custom Apollo Router binary
---

To use plugins that are not bundled with the default Apollo Router distribution you will need to create your own Apollo Router binary.

This page will walk you through creating your own Router binary from scratch, and creating a simple plugin.

> Note: The Apollo Router is made available under the Elastic License v2.0 (ELv2).
> Read [our licensing page](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/elastic-license-v2-faq/) for more details.

# Prerequisites

To compile the Apollo Router you will need to have the following installed.

<!-- renovate-automation: rustc version -->
* [rust 1.61.0](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* nodejs 16.9.1

Once you have the basics installed, install `cargo-xtask` and `cargo-scaffold`
```bash
cargo install cargo-xtask
cargo install cargo-scaffold
```

# Create new project

1. Use `cargo-scaffold` to create the project.
   
   ```bash
   cargo-scaffold scaffold https://github.com/apollographql/router.git -r apollo-router-scaffold/templates/base
   ```
   You will be asked some questions about your project. For the purposes of this tutorial name your project `starstuff`.
   
2. After the project has been created change to the `starstuff` directory
   ```bash
   cd starstuff
   ```
The generated project has the following layout:
```bash
starstuff
├── Cargo.toml       # Dependencies are declared here
├── README.md
├── router.yaml      # Router yaml config
├── src
│   ├── main.rs      # Entry point.
│   └── plugins      # Custom plugins are located here.
│       └── mod.rs
└── xtask            # Build support files
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── main.rs
```

The Apollo Router uses an auto discovery mechanism for plugin discovery, so any plugins that are added via dependency will automatically be available to the Router at runtime. 

# Compile the Router

To create a debug build use the following command.
```bash
cargo build
```
Your debug binary is now located in `target/debug/router`

For production, you will want to create a release build.
```bash
cargo build --release
```
Your release binary is now located in `target/release/router`

# Run the Apollo Router

1. Download the example schema

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://supergraph.demo.starstuff.dev/ > supergraph-schema.graphql
   ```

2. Run the Apollo Router
   
   During development it is convenient to use `cargo run` to run the Apollo Router as it will 
   ```bash 
   cargo run -- --hot-reload --config router.yaml --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
   ```
   
> If you are using managed federation you can set APOLLO_KEY and APOLLO_GRAPH_REF environment variables instead of specifying the supergraph as a file.

# Create a plugin

1. From within your project directory scaffold a new plugin
   ```bash
   cargo router plugin create hello_world
   ```
2. Select the type of plugin you want to scaffold:
   ```bash
   Select a plugin template:
   > "basic"
   "auth"
   "tracing"
   ```
   
   The different templates are:
   * basic - a barebones plugin.
   * auth - a basic authentication plugin that could make an external call.
   * tracing - a plugin that adds a custom span and a log message.
   
   Choose `basic`.

4. Add the plugin to the `router.yaml`
   ```yaml
   plugins:
     starstuff.hello_world:
       message: "starting my plugin"
   ```

5. Run the Apollo Router and see your plugin start up
   ```bash
   cargo run -- --hot-reload --config router.yaml --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
   ```
    
   In your output you should see something like:
   ```bash
   2022-05-21T09:16:33.160288Z  INFO router::plugins::hello_world: starting my plugin
   ```

# Remove a plugin

From within your project run the following command. It makes a best effort to remove the plugin, but your mileage may vary. 
```bash
cargo router plugin remove hello_world
```
