title: Federation version support in the Apollo Router
---

import { Link } from 'gatsby';

The Apollo Router uses Apollo Federation 2.x. Federation 2.x
is [backward compatible with Federation 1.x](/federation/federation-2/backward-compatibility/), so you can use the router with a valid Federation 1.x supergraph.

> If your Federation 1.x supergraph _doesn't_ work with the Apollo Router, see [Backward compatibility in Federation 2](/federation/federation-2/backward-compatibility/) for possible causes.

Apollo Federation is an evolving project, and it will receive new features and bug fixes over time. If you need to run a particular version of federation, the following table shows which version of federation each router release is compiled against:

<table class="field-table">
