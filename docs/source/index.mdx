GraphOS Router is a scalable runtime for supergraphs that's fully integrated with GraphOS and based on the Apollo Router Core.

A self-hosted GraphOS Router enables full management of your supergraph runtime infrastructure and deployments.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["<b>GraphOS Router</b>"]);
  serviceB[Products<br/>API];
  serviceC[Reviews<br/>API];
  router -->|Sub-query| serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.->|Query| router;
  class clients secondary;
```

The GraphOS Router intelligently distributes inbound queries across your GraphQL-powered microservices, enabling clients to fetch data from multiple sources with a single request.

If you have an existing federated graph that currently uses `@apollo/gateway`, you can move to the GraphOS Router without changing any other part of your graph.

> **This documentation helps you run a _self-hosted_ instance of the GraphOS Router.** If you [create a cloud supergraph](/graphos/quickstart/cloud/) with Apollo GraphOS, Apollo provisions and hosts your router for you.
>
> Cloud supergraphs are recommended for organizations that don't need to host their router in their own infrastructure.
