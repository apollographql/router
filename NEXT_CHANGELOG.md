## 🐛 Fixes ( :bug: )

### Support introspection object types ([PR #1240](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1240))


### Update the scaffold template so it works with Streams ([#1247](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1247))

Release v0.9.4 changed the way we deal with Response objects, which can now be streams.
This Pull request updates the scaffold template so it generates plugins that are compatible with the new Plugin API.

Introspection queries can use a set of object types defined in the specification. The query parsing code was not recognizing them,
resulting in some introspection queries not working.
