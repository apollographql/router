Learn how to deploy the router on Render's managed hosting platform.

You will:
- Deploy using the Apollo Router template for quick setup
- Configure environment variables and deployment settings
- Customize your deployment with advanced configuration options

## Prerequisites

Before you start:

1. [Set up a GraphQL API in GraphOS](/graphos/get-started/guides/graphql#step-1-set-up-your-graphql-api).
    - Save your `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`. You'll need them when deploying the router.
1. Create a [Render account](https://render.com/) or use an existing account.
1. Have a GitHub account (for template deployment or custom repository setup).

## Option 1: Quick deployment with template (Recommended)

The fastest way to deploy the Apollo Router on Render is using the official template:

1. Deploy the template:
   - Visit the [Apollo Router Template repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router-template)
   - Click the **Deploy to Render** button: [![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=github.com/apollographql/router-template)

2. Configure your service:
   - Service Name: Enter a name for your router service (e.g., `my-apollo-router`)
   - Branch: Select `main` (or your preferred branch)

3. Set environment variables:
   - `APOLLO_KEY`: Your Graph API key from GraphOS Studio
   - `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`: Your graph reference (e.g., `my-graph@production`)
   - `PORT`: Set to `4000` (this is already configured in the template)

4. Deploy: Click **Create Web Service** to start the deployment.

5. Verify deployment: Once deployed, visit your service URL to confirm the router is running. You should see the router's GraphQL Playground or health check endpoint.

## Option 2: Custom deployment

If you need more control over your deployment, you can set up a custom deployment using the Apollo Runtime container image:

### Using Apollo Runtime container image

The Apollo Runtime container image provides a production-ready router with sensible defaults, eliminating the need for complex configuration in most cases.

1. Fork the [router-template](https://github.com/apollographql/router-template) for the following files:

2. (Optional) Create a `router.yaml` configuration file for custom settings:
    
    ```yaml title="router.yaml"
    # The Apollo Runtime container comes with sensible defaults
    # Only create this file if you need custom configuration
    supergraph:
        listen: 0.0.0.0:4000
    health_check:
        listen: 0.0.0.0:8088
    cors:
      # Development setting - replace for production
      allow_any_origin: true
    ```

3. Create a `Dockerfile`:

    ```dockerfile
    # Use the official Apollo Runtime container as the base
    FROM ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-runtime:0.0.14_router2.5.0_mcp-server0.7.0

    # Optionally copy custom router configuration
    # COPY router.yaml /config/router_config.yaml
    ```

4. Create a `render.yaml` file for Render-specific configuration:

    ```yaml title="render.yaml"
    services:
      - type: web
        name: apollo-router
        runtime: docker
        plan: free  # or starter/standard based on your needs
        envVars:
          - key: APOLLO_GRAPH_REF
            sync: false  # Set this manually in Render dashboard
          - key: APOLLO_KEY
            sync: false  # Set this manually in Render dashboard
          - key: PORT
            value: "4000"
            sync: true
        region: oregon  # or your preferred region
        dockerContext: .
        dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
        rootDir: ./
    version: "1"
    ```

### Deploy to Render

1. Connect your repository:
   - In your Render dashboard, click **New** > **Web Service**
   - Connect your GitHub repository containing the router configuration

2. Configure the service:
   - Runtime: Docker
   - Build Command: Leave empty (Docker handles the build)
   - Start Command: Leave empty (defined in Dockerfile)

3. Set environment variables:
   - Add `APOLLO_KEY` and set it to your Graph API key
   - Add `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` and set it to your graph reference
   - Add `PORT` and set it to `4000`

4. Deploy: Click **Create Web Service**

## Apollo MCP Server

The Apollo Runtime container includes an optional MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI assistants with structured access to your GraphQL schema and operations.

### Enable the MCP Server

The MCP server is disabled by default. To enable it, set the `MCP_ENABLE` environment variable to `1`:

In Render dashboard:
1. Go to your service's **Environment** tab
2. Add `MCP_ENABLE` with value `1`
3. Redeploy your service

In render.yaml:
```yaml title="render.yaml"
envVars:
  - key: MCP_ENABLE
    value: "1"
    sync: true
```
