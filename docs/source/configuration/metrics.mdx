title: Collecting metrics in the Apollo Router
---

The Apollo Router provides built-in support for metrics collection via [Prometheus](#using-prometheus) and [OpenTelemetry Collector](#using-opentelemetry-collector).

## Using Prometheus

You can use [Prometheus and Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) to collect metrics and visualize the router metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      # By setting this endpoint you enable the prometheus exporter
      # All our endpoints exposed by plugins are namespaced by the name of the plugin
      # Then to access to this prometheus endpoint, the full url path will be `/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus`
      enabled: true
```

Assuming you are running locally:

1. Run a query against the router.
2. Navigate to [http://localhost:4000/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus](http://localhost:4000/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus) to see something like:

```
# HELP http_request_duration_seconds Total number of HTTP requests made.
# TYPE http_request_duration_seconds histogram
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"} 1
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.9"} 1
---SNIP---
```

Note that if you have not run a query against the router you will see a blank page as no metrics will have been generated yet!

Here is the list of available metrics you'll have using Prometheus:

- HTTP router request duration (`http_request_duration_seconds_bucket`)
- HTTP request duration by subgraph (`http_request_duration_seconds_bucket` with attribute `subgraph`)
- Total number of HTTP requests by HTTP Status (`http_requests_total`)
- Total number of HTTP requests in error (`http_requests_error_total`)

## Using OpenTelemetry Collector

You may send metrics to [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) for processing and reporting metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    otlp:
      # Either 'default' or a URL
      endpoint: default

      # Optional protocol. Only grpc is supported currently.
      # Setting to http will result in configuration failure.
      protocol: grpc

      # Optional Grpc configuration
      grpc:
        domain_name: "my.domain"
        key:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        ca:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        cert:
          file: ""
          # env: ""
        metadata:
          foo: bar

      # Optional timeout in humatime form
      timeout: 2s
```

## Add custom attributes/labels

If you need to add attributes/labels on your generated metrics, for example add a custom attributes/labels coming from a specific header in the original HTTP router request, or insert custom attributes/labels on every metrics.
You also have access to the body of subgraph/router request/response. And be able to add a custom attribute coming from the context filled in the plugins chain.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      attributes:
        router:
          static:
            - name: "version"
              value: "v1.0.0"
          request:
            header:
              - named: "content-type"
                rename: "payload_type"
                default: "application/json"
              - named: "x-custom-header-to-add"
          response:
            body:
              # Take element from the response body of the router located at this path
              - path: .errors[0].extensions.status
                name: error_from_body
          context:
            # Take element from context in plugin chains and add it in attributes
            - named: my_key
        subgraph:
          all:
            static:
              # Always insert on all metrics for all subgraphs
              - name: kind
                value: subgraph_request
          subgraphs:
            my_subgraph_name: # Apply these rules only for the subgraph named `my_subgraph_name`
              request:
                header:
                  - named: "x-custom-header"
                body:
                  # Take element from the request body of the router located at this path (here it's the query)
                  - path: .query
                    name: query
                    default: UNKNOWN
```

### Example of JSON Query to extract data from the body

If you have this data:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "unwanted": 7,
      "wanted": { "x": 3, "y": 7 },
      "array": [3, 2, 1]
    },
    {
      "whatever": true
    }
  ]
}
```

And want to fetch the field `whatever` here is the syntax `.items[1].whatever`. You can also try to fetch the field `x` by using this query `.items[0].wanted.x`. A JSON Query is always starting with a dot.
