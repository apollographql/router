description: Configure the Prometheus metrics exporter endpoint in the Apollo Router.
---

Enable and configure the [Prometheus](https://www.prometheus.io/) exporter for metrics in the Apollo Router.

For general metrics configuration, refer to [Router Metrics Configuration](./overview).

## Prometheus configuration

To export metrics to Prometheus, enable the Prometheus endpoint and set its address and path in [`router.yaml`](../../../overview#yaml-config-file):

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
     metrics:
       prometheus:
         enabled: true
         listen: 127.0.0.1:9090
         path: /metrics
```

Once enabled, you will be able to access the Prometheus endpoint at `http://localhost:9090/metrics`.

You can configure your APM agent to scrape the metrics from the endpoint. See the documentation for your APM agent for more details.

### `enabled`

Set to true to enable the Prometheus exporter. Defaults to false.

### `listen`

The address and port to listen on for Prometheus metrics. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`.

### `path`

The path to expose the Prometheus metrics. Defaults to `/metrics`.

| Attribute     | Default          | Description                                |
|---------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`     | `false`          | Enable the Prometheus exporter.            |
| `listen`      | `127.0.0.1:9090` | The address to serve Prometheus metric on. |
| `path`        | `/metrics`       | The path to serve Prometheus metrics on.   |


## Using Prometheus with containers

The Prometheus endpoint listens to `127.0.0.1` by default, which won't allow connections issued from a network.

While this is a safe default, _other containers won't be able to access the Prometheus endpoint_, which will disable metric scraping.

You can enable other containers to access it by setting the endpoint to listen to `0.0.0.0`:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
     metrics:
       prometheus:
         # By setting this endpoint you enable other containers and pods to access the Prometheus endpoint
         enabled: true
         listen: 0.0.0.0:9090 #highlight-line
         path: /metrics
```

You can validate your setting locally:

1. Run a query against the router.
2. Navigate to [http://localhost:9090/metrics](http://localhost:9090/metrics), and check that the endpoint returns metrics similar to the following:

    ```
    # HELP apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds Total number of HTTP requests made.
    # TYPE apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds histogram
    apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"} 1
    apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.9"} 1
    ---SNIP---
    ```

<Note>

If you haven't run a query against the router yet, you'll see a blank page because no metrics have been generated.
