Learn how to upgrade your GraphOS Router deployment from version 1.x to 2.x.

<Note>

GraphOS Router 2.x is available as a [Developer Preview](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/router-release-lifecycle#developer-preview). The most recent version is **[v2.0.0-preview.1](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v2.0.0-preview.1)**. This upgrade guide will be updated throughout the Developer Preview and will have additions after each release.

</Note>

## New configuration in GraphOS Router v2.0.0-preview.x

The router v2.x introduces some new features that can impact the configuration from v1.x.

### Apollo operation usage reporting via OTLP

The router supports reporting operation usage metrics to GraphOS via OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP).

Prior to version 1.49.0 of the router, all GraphOS reporting was performed using a [private tracing format](/graphos/metrics/sending-operation-metrics#reporting-format). In v1.49.0, we introduced support for using OTel to perform this reporting. In v1.x, this is controlled using the `experimental_otlp_tracing_sampler` flag, and it's off by default.

Now in v2.x, this flag is renamed to `otlp_tracing_sampler`, and it's enabled by default.

Learn more about configuring [usage reporting via OTLP](/router/configuration/telemetry/apollo-telemetry#usage-reporting-via-opentelemetry-protocol-otlp).

### Metrics reporting defaults

Default values of some GraphOS reporting metrics have been changed from v1.x to the following in v2.x:

- `telemetry.apollo.signature_normalization_algorithm` now defaults to `enhanced`. (In v1.x the default is `legacy`.)
- `telemetry.apollo.metrics_reference_mode` now defaults to `extended`. (In v1.x the default is `standard`.)

## Removed features in GraphOS Router v2.x

### Support for Scaffold

<!-- PR: https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6274 -->

In Router v1.x Scaffold could be used to generate boilerplate source code for a Rust Plugin which extended functionality in a custom Router. This facility has been removed.

Source code generated using Scaffold will continue to compile; so existing Rust plugins will be unaffected by this change.

### `--apollo-uplink-poll-interval`

<!-- PR: https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6268 -->

The router no longer uses the `--apollo-uplink-poll-interval` command-line argument, or the `APOLLO_UPLINK_POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable. It already did something unusual in v1.x: the configured interval would only be used for the very first poll, and not any subsequent polls.

## Upgrading to GraphOS Router v2.x

Upgrading from GraphOS Router v1.x to v2.x requires the following steps.

### Configure your Apollo usage reporting protocol

If your router v1.x is configured with `experimental_otlp_tracing_sampler`, rename it to `otlp_tracing_sampler`.

To [report operation usage metrics to GraphOS via OTLP](#apollo-operation-usage-reporting-via-otlp), you can either remove your configuration of `otlp_tracing_sampler` and use its default value, or you can explicitly enable it by setting it to [`always_on` or a sampling ratio](/router/configuration/telemetry/apollo-telemetry#configuring-usage-reporting-via-otlp).

Otherwise, to use the behavior of v1.x, turn off usage reporting via OTLP by setting `otlp_tracing_sampler` to `always_off`.

### Configure metrics reporting defaults

If you plan to use the [new metrics reporting defaults](#metrics-reporting-defaults), then no changes are required.

Otherwise, to use the defaults from v1.x, set the following:

```yaml
telemetry:
  apollo:
    signature_normalization_algorithm: legacy
    metrics_reference_mode: standard
```

### Configure supergraph endpoint path

If you use the default endpoint path or your path has no matched parameters or wildcards, then no changes are required.

If your path uses named parameters, it is now bound with a braces syntax instead of a colon:

```yaml
supergraph:
  # Previously:
  # path: /foo/:bar/baz
  path: /foo/{bar}/baz
```

If your path uses a wildcard, it must be wrapped in braces and must bind a name:

```yaml
supergraph:
  # Previously:
  # path: /foo/*
  path: /foo/{*rest}
```

### Logging

<!-- PR: https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/6285 -->

If you used the `experimental_when_header` feature previously like this for example:

```yaml title="router.previous.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    logging:
      # If one of these headers matches we will log supergraph and subgraphs requests/responses
      experimental_when_header: # REMOVED
        - name: apollo-router-log-request
          value: my_client
          headers: true # default: false
          body: true # default: false
```

This feature no longer exists and can be replaced with another one included in custom telemetry. Here is how you would configure custom telemetry to achieve the same result:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router:
        request: # Display router request log
          level: info
          condition:
            eq:
              - request_header: apollo-router-log-request
              - my_client
        response: # Display router response log
          level: info
          condition:
            eq:
              - request_header: apollo-router-log-request
              - my_client
      supergraph:
        request: # Display supergraph request log
          level: info
          condition:
            eq:
              - request_header: apollo-router-log-request
              - my_client
        response:
          level: info
          condition:
            eq:
              - request_header: apollo-router-log-request
              - my_client
      subgraph:
        request: # Display subgraph request log
          level: info
          condition:
            eq:
              - supergraph_request_header: apollo-router-log-request
              - my_client
        response: # Display subgraph response log
          level: info
          condition:
            eq:
              - supergraph_request_header: apollo-router-log-request
              - my_client
```

### Metrics

- `apollo_router_http_request_retry_total` has been removed and will be supported now by `http.client.request.duration` metrics
  with the `http.request.resend_count` attribute which is automatically set when `default_requirement_level` is set to `recommended`.

- `apollo_router_timeout` has been removed. This metric conflated timed-out requests from client to the router, and requests from the router to subgraphs.
  Timed-out requests have HTTP status code 504. Use the `http.response.status_code` attribute on the `http.server.request.duration` metric to identify timed-out router requests,
  and the same attribute on the `http.client.request.duration` metric to identify timed-out subgraph requests.

- `apollo_router_http_requests_total` has been removed and replaced by `http.server.request.duration` metric for requests from clients to router and `http.client.request.duration` for requests from router to subgraphs.

- `apollo_router_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket` has been removed and replaced by `http.server.request.duration` metric for requests from clients to router and `http.client.request.duration` for requests from router to subgraphs.

- `apollo_router_session_count_total` has been removed and replaced by `http.server.active_requests`.

### Check CORS configuration

If you already configured [CORS](../../routing/security/cors) on the router, the configuration won't change but with v1.x it accepted bad configuration and displayed an error log when some header names or regexes were invalid.
With v2.x it will end up with an error and it won't start at all to avoid confusions and misconfigurations.

### Deploy your router

Make sure that you are referencing the correct router release: **v2.0.0-preview.0**

During upgrade, carefully monitor logs and resource consumption to ensure that your router has successfully upgraded and that your router has enough resources to perform as expected. The router will automatically migrate required configuration changes, but it is good practice to review the steps above and decide if you want to change your configuration.

For example, you may decide that you wish to change the way in which you sample OTLP traces in this new release and not simply preserve your existing configuration.
