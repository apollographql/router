## üêõ Fixes

### Support introspection object types ([PR #1240](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1240))

Introspection queries can use a set of object types defined in the specification. The query parsing code was not recognizing them,
resulting in some introspection queries not working.

### Create the ExecutionResponse after the primary response was generated ([PR #1260](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1260))

The `@defer` preliminary work has a surprising side effect: when using methods like `RouterResponse::map_response`, they are
executed before the subgraph responses are received, because they work on the stream of responses.
This PR goes back to the previous behaviour by awaiting the primary response before creating the ExecutionResponse.

### Update README link to the configuration file  ([PR #1208](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1208))

As the structure of the documentation has changed, the link should point to the `YAML config file` section of the overview.
