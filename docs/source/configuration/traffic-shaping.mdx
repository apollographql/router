title: Traffic shaping in the Apollo Router
---

The Apollo Router supports the following types of traffic shaping between itself and your subgraphs:

- **Sub-query deduplication** - Whenever the router is sending multiple identical in-flight query operations to a subgraph, it can consolidate them into a single request.
  - Mutation operations are never deduplicated.
  - Only in-flight requests are deduplicated.
- **Variable deduplication** - If a request to a subgraph includes multiple GraphQL variables with the same value, the router can replace those with a single variable.
- **Compression** - The router can compress request bodies to subgraphs (along with response bodies to clients) with a supported algorithm
  - The router currently supports `gzip`, `br`, and `deflate`.
- **Global rate limiting** - If you want to rate limit requests to subgraphs or to the router itself.
- **Timeout**: - Set a timeout to subgraphs and router requests.
- **APQ**: - Whether to use Automatic Persisted Queries (APQ) in subgraph calls.
- **Request Retry**: - retry subgraph requests if they fail due to network errors. This implements Finagle's retry buckets mechanism. **Experimental feature**: retry configuration might change in the future.

Each of these optimizations can reduce network bandwidth and CPU usage for your subgraphs.

## Configuration

To enable traffic shaping, add the `traffic_shaping` plugin to your [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file), like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
traffic_shaping:
  deduplicate_variables: true # Enable the variable deduplication optimization.
  router: # Rules applied to requests from clients to the router
    global_rate_limit: # Accept a maximum of 10 requests per 5 secs. Excess requests must be rejected.
      capacity: 10
      interval: 5s # Must not be greater than 18_446_744_073_709_551_615 milliseconds and not less than 0 milliseconds
    timeout: 50s # If a request to the router takes more than 50secs then cancel the request (30 sec by default)
  all:
    deduplicate_query: true # Enable query deduplication for all subgraphs.
    compression: br # Enable brotli compression for all subgraphs.
  subgraphs: # Rules applied to requests from the router to individual subgraphs
    products:
      deduplicate_query: false # Disable query deduplication for the products subgraph.
      compression: gzip # Enable gzip compression only for the products subgraph.
      global_rate_limit: # Accept a maximum of 10 requests per 5 secs from the router. Excess requests must be rejected.
        capacity: 10
        interval: 5s # Must not be greater than 18_446_744_073_709_551_615 milliseconds and not less than 0 milliseconds
      timeout: 50s # If a request to the subgraph 'products' takes more than 50secs then cancel the request (30 sec by default)
      apq: false # Do not use automatic persisted queries for http calls to 'products' subgraph. (true by default)
      experimental_retry:
        min_per_sec: 10 # minimal number of retries per second (`min_per_sec`, default is 10 retries per second)
        ttl: 10s # for each successful request, we register a token, that expires according to this option (default: 10s)
        retry_percent: 0.2 # defines the proportion of available retries to the current number of tokens
        retry_mutations: false # allows retries on mutations. This should only be enabled if mutations are idempotent

```

Any configuration under the `subgraphs` key takes precedence over configuration under the `all` key. In the example above, query deduplication is enabled for all subgraphs _except_ the `products` subgraph.
