# Temporary patch to async-compression
# It is used by tower-http's CompressionLayer. The compression code was not handling
# the Poll::Pending result from the underlying stream, so it was accumulating the
# entire compressed response in memory before sending it, which creates issues with
# deferred responses getting received too late
