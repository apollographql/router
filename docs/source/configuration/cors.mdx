The Apollo Router supports [Cross Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
to indicate from which origin it accepts requests. **By default, it accepts requests from all origins**.
If your environment has specific security requirements around CORS, they can be set up in the configuration file:

```yaml title="config.router.yaml"
server:
  #
  # CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
  #
  cors:
    # Set to false to disallow any origin and rely exclusively on `origins`
    # Defaults to true
    allow_any_origin: true
    # List of accepted origins
    origins:
      - https://studio.apollographql.com
    # Set to true to add the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header
    allow_credentials: false
    # The headers to allow.
    # Defaults to the required request header for Apollo Studio: Content-Type
    allow_headers: [ Content-Type ]
    # Allowed request methods
    # Defaults to GET, POST, OPTIONS.
    methods: [ GET, POST, OPTIONS ]
    # Which response headers should be made available to scripts running in the
    # browser in response to a cross-origin request.
    expose_headers:
```
