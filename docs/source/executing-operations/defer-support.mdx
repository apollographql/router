Queries sent to the Apollo Router can use the `@defer` directive to enable the incremental delivery of response data. By deferring data for some fields, the router can resolve and return data for the query's _other_ fields more quickly, improving responsiveness.

The Apollo Router's `@defer` support is compatible with all [federation-compatible subgraph libraries](/federation/supported-subgraphs/). That's because the router takes advantage of your supergraph's existing [entities](/federation/entities/) to fetch any deferred field data via followup queries to your subgraphs.

## What is `@defer`?

The `@defer` directive enables a client query to specify sets of fields that it doesn't need to receive data for _immediately_. This is helpful whenever some fields in a query take much longer to resolve than others.

Deferred fields are always contained within a GraphQL fragment, and the `@defer` directive is applied to that fragment (_not_ to the individual fields).

Here's an example query that uses `@defer`:

```graphql
query GetUserAndFriends($userId: ID!) {
  user(id: $userId) {
    # Basic fields (fast)
    id
    name {
      firstName
      lastName
    }

    # highlight-start
    # Friend fields (slower)
    ... @defer {
      friends {
        id
      }
    }
    # highlight-end
  }
}
```

When resolving the above query, a GraphQL server can respond **incrementally**: it first returns data for the "basic fields", then later completes its response by returning data for the "friend fields".

To respond incrementally, the Apollo Router uses a multipart-encoded HTTP response. To use `@defer` successfully with the Apollo Router, a client's GraphQL library must _also_ support the directive by handling multipart HTTP responses correctly.

## Using `@defer` with the router

The Apollo Router supports deferring data for any of the following fields in your schema:

- Fields of [entity types](#entity-fields)
- Root fields of the [`Query` type](#fields-of-query)

If a query defers one of the above fields, it can _also_ defer any _subfields_ of that field:

```graphql
query DeferExample {
  users {
    id
  }

  # highlight-start
  ... @defer {
    products {
      name
    }
  }
  # highlight-end
}
```

In the example query above, `products` is a root field of the `Query` type, so it can be deferred. The `name` subfield can _also_ be deferred, because it appears within a deferrable field in the fragment.

In supergraphs that use entities, a large percentage of all fields in your schema can be deferred. [See an example of a non-deferrable field.](#non-deferrable-fields)

### Entity fields

The Apollo Router supports using `@defer` with fields of all [entity types](/federation/entities/) in your supergraph. Entities are object types with at least one `@key`, which specifies the fields that can uniquely identify any given instance of that type.

Here's an example subgraph schema that defines a `User` entity:

```graphql title="Users subgraph"
type User @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: Name!
  friends: [User!]!
}

type Name {
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}
```

Because the `User` type is an entity, the router supports deferring any of its fields.

Here's an example query:

```graphql
query GetUser($userId: ID!) {
  user(id: $userId) {
    id
    # highlight-start
    ... @defer {
      name {
        firstName
        lastName
      }
    }
    # highlight-end
  }
}
```

Remember that this query can _also_ successfully defer `firstName` and `lastName` because they're _subfields_ of a deferrable field in the fragment.

### Fields of `Query`

The Apollo Router also supports using `@defer` with the root fields of your supergraph's `Query` type:

```graphql
query PartiallyDeferredQuery {
  products {
    id
  }
  # highlight-start
  ... @defer {
    users {
      id
    }
  }
  # highlight-end
}
```

In this example, the router immediately begins resolving both `Query.products` _and_ `Query.users` (along with their subfields). However, the router responds with data for the `Query.products` part as soon as it's ready, instead of waiting for the `Query.users` part to finish. It later completes its response with data for `Query.users`.

> It is invalid to use `@defer` with root fields of the `Mutation` type.

### Non-deferrable fields

A query's `@defer` fragment might include fields that the Apollo Router _can't_ defer. The router handles this case gracefully with the following logic:

- The router defers every field in the fragment that it _can_ defer.
- The router resolves any non-deferrable fields in the fragment _before_ sending its initial response to the client.
- The router's response to the client still uses multipart encoding to separate `@defer` fragment fields from other fields, even if some fragment fields are non-deferrable.
    - This preserves the response structure that the client expects based on its use of `@defer`.

#### Example

To illustrate a non-deferrable field, let's look at an example using this subgraph schema:

```graphql
type Book @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  author: Author!
}

type Author {
  name: String!
  books: [Book!]!
}

type Query {
  books: [Book!]!
  authors: [Author!]!
}
```

Note in this schema that the `Book` type is an entity and the `Author` type is _not_.

Let's say a client executes the following query:

```graphql
query GetAuthors {
  authors {
    name
    # highlight-start
    ... @defer {
      books { # Can't be deferred
        title # CAN be deferred
      }
    }
    # highlight-end
  }
}
```

This query _attempts_ to defer two fields: `Author.books` and `Book.title`.

- `Author.books` is _not_ the field of an entity type (`Author` is not an entity), so the router _can't_ defer it.
- `Book.title` _is_ the field of an entity type, so the router _can_ defer it.
    - If `Book.title` had any subfields, the router could also defer _those_ fields.

In this case, the router must internally resolve each author's list of associated `books` _before_ it can send its initial response to the client. Later, it can resolve each book's `title` and return those `Book` objects to the client in an incremental part of the response.

## Specification status

The `@defer` directive is currently part of a draft-stage RFC for the GraphQL specification ([learn about RFC contribution stages](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#rfc-contribution-stages)).

The Apollo Router supports the `@defer` directive as it's documented in [these edits to the RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/742), according to the state of those edits on 2022-08-24.

## Disabling defer

Defer is enabled by default. If you wish to disable `@defer`, you can do so via router.yaml:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
  defer_support: false
```
