### Reorganize observability documentation structure ([PR #8183](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/8183))

Restructured the router observability and telemetry documentation to improve content discoverability and user experience. GraphOS insights documentation and router OpenTelemetry telemetry documentation are now in separate sections, with APM-specific documentation organized in dedicated folders for each APM provider (Datadog, Dynatrace, Jaeger, Prometheus, New Relic, Zipkin). This reorganization makes it easier for users to find relevant monitoring and observability configuration for their specific APM tools.
