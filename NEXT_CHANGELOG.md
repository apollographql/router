## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó
## üöÄ Features

### Support serviceMonitor in helm chart

`kube-prometheus-stack` ignores scrape annotations, so a `serviceMonitor` CRD is required to scrape a given target to avoid scrape_configs.

### Add support of dynamic header injection ([Issue #1755](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1755))

+ Insert static header

```yaml
headers:
  all: # Header rules for all subgraphs
    request:
    - insert:
        name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router"
        value: "indeed"
```

+ Insert header from context

```yaml
headers:
  all: # Header rules for all subgraphs
    request:
    - insert:
        name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router-context"
        from_context: "my_key_in_context"
```

+ Insert header from request body

```yaml
headers:
  all: # Header rules for all subgraphs
    request:
    + insert:
        name: "sent-from-our-apollo-router-request-body"
        path: ".operationName" # It's a JSON path query to fetch the operation name from request body
        default: "UNKNOWN" # If no operationName has been specified
```

## üêõ Fixes

### Do not erase errors when missing `_entities` ([Issue #1863](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1863))

in a federated query, if the subgraph returned a response with errors and a null or absent data field, the router
was ignoring the subgraph error and instead returning an error complaining about the missing` _entities` field.
This will now aggregate the subgraph error and the missing `_entities` error.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Have CI use rust-toolchain.toml and not install another redudant toolchain ([Issue #1313](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1313))

Avoids redundant work in CI and makes the YAML configuration less mis-leading.

By [@garypen](https://github.com/garypen) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1877

### Query plan execution refactoring ([PR #1843](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1843))

This splits the query plan execution in multiple modules to make the code more manageable.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1843

### Remove `Buffer` from APQ ([PR #1641](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1641))

This removes `tower::Buffer` usage from the Automated Persisted Queries implementation to improve reliability.
