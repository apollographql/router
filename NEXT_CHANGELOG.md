## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Remove `activate()` from the plugin API ([PR #1569](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1569))

Recent changes to configuration reloading means that the only known consumer of this API, telemetry, is no longer using it.

Let's remove it since it's simple to add back if later required.

### QueryPlan::usage_reporting and QueryPlannerContent are private ([Issue #1556](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1556))

These items have been removed from the public API of `apollo_router::services::execution`.

## üöÄ Features
## üêõ Fixes

### Only send one report for a response with deferred responses ([PR #1576](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1576))

The router was sending one report per response (even deferred ones), while Studio was expecting one report for the entire
response. The router now sends one report, that measures the latency of the entire operation.

### Include formatted query plan when exposing the query plan ([#1557](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1557))

Move the location of the `text` field when exposing the query plan and fill it with a formatted query plan.
