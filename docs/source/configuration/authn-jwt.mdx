The Apollo Router provides experimental support for request authentication via [JSON Web Token](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519) (JWT). This feature uses the popular [jsonwebtoken Rust library](https://crates.io/crates/jsonwebtoken), which supports a variety of signature algorithms.

## How it works

These are the high-level steps of JWT-based authentication with the Apollo Router:

1. Whenever a client authenticates with your system, your identity provider (or a similar service) issues that client a valid JSON Web Token (JWT).
2. In all followup requests to your supergraph, the authenticated client provides its JWT in a designated HTTP header.
3. Whenever your router receives a client request, it extracts the JWT from the designated header (if it's present).
4. Your router validates the extracted JWT using a corresponding [JSON Web Key](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517) (JWK).
    - Your router obtains all of its known JWKs from URLs that you specify in its configuration file. Each URL must provide keys within a single JSON object called a [JWK Set](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517#section-5) (or a JWKS).
    - JWT validation fails if the token is malformed, or if it's been expired for more than 60 seconds (this window accounts for synchronization issues).

5. The router extracts all **claims** from the validated JWT and includes them in the request's context, which makes them available to [router customizations](../customizations/overview/). This enables customizations to handle the request differently depending on the details of those claims ([see below](#accessing-jwt-claims-from-the-context)).

## Setup

You enable JWT authentication in your router's [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file), under the `authentication.experimental` key:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
authentication:
  experimental:
    jwt:
      jwks_urls:
        - https://dev-zzp5enui.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json
      # These are the DEFAULT values for the following keys:
      header_name: Authorization
      header_value_prefix: Bearer
      cooldown: 15s
```

You will see a log message confirming which `jwks_urls` are in use during router startup that looks like this:

```
2023-02-03T14:05:28.018932Z  INFO JWT authentication using JWKSets from these jwks_urls=["file:///router/jwks.json"]
```

The following configuration options are supported:

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Option</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr class="required">
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `jwks_urls`

</td>
<td>

**Required.** The list of URLs of the JWK Sets (JWKS) that the router should use. Each list entry Can be an `https://` or a `file://` URL.

**If _any_ of your JWKs uses a symmetric signature algorithm (such as `HS256`), always use a `file://` URL.** Symmetric signature algorithms use a shared key that should never be accessible over the network.

For more information, see [Providing keys to the router](#providing-keys-to-the-router).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `header_name`

</td>
<td>

The name of the HTTP header that client requests will use to provide their JWT to the router. Must be a valid name for an HTTP header.

The default value is `Authorization`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `header_value_prefix`

</td>
<td>

The string that will always precede the JWT in the header value corresponding to [`header_name`](#header_name). This value must not include whitespace.

The default value is `Bearer`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `cooldown`

</td>
<td>

Whenever the router receives a JWT with a key ID (`kid`) that it doesn't recognize, it fetches up-to-date JWK Sets from its [`jwks_urls`](#jwks_urls), _as long as_ it's been _at least_ the amount of time specified by `cooldown`.

The default value is `15s`. In almost all cases, you don't need to override this value.

</tr>

## Accessing JWT claims from the context

After the Apollo Router validates a client request's JWT, it adds that token's **claims** to the request's context at the key `apollo_authentication::JWT::claims`.

This enables you to define custom logic for handling a request based on the details of the JWT's claims. You can define this logic as a Rhai script or a native Rust plugin. For details on these, see [Customizations for the Apollo Router](../customizations/overview/).

Here's an example of a Rhai script that throws distinct errors for different invalid JWT claim details:

```rhai title="jwt_claims.rhai"
fn process_request(request) {
    try {
        // Note: APOLLO_AUTHENTICATION_JWT_CLAIMS is a Rhai-scope constant with
        // value `apollo_authentication::JWT::claims`
        let claims = request.context[APOLLO_AUTHENTICATION_JWT_CLAIMS];
        if claims == () {
            throw #{
                status: 401,
                message: "No claims presented in this request"
            };
        }
        if !claims.contains("iss") {
            throw #{
                status: 401,
                message: "No issuer presented in this request"
            };
        }
        if claims["iss"] != "https://idp.local" {
            throw #{
                status: 401,
                message: `Issuer ${claims.iss} is not accepted here`
            };
        }
        // Happy path: We have valid claims from the correct idP.
        // Proceed accordingly (in this case, we just log the claims).
        print(`claims: ${claims}`);
    }
    catch(err)
    {
        // log any errors
        log_error(`Error during claims processing: ${err}`);
        throw err;
    }
}
```

## Propagating JWTs to subgraphs

Because clients provide their JWT via an HTTP header, you can propagate JWTs to some or all of your subgraphs using the Apollo Router's general-purpose [header propagation settings](./header-propagation).

## Providing keys to the router

The Apollo Router obtains each JSON Web Key (JWK) that it uses from URLs that you specify via the [`jwks_urls`](#jwks_urls) configuration option. Each URL must provide a set of valid JWKs in a single JSON object called a **JWK Set** (or JWKS).

Many popular identity provider services (such as [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/validate-access-tokens/-/main/#retrieve-the-json-web-keys) and [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-key-sets)) create a JWKS and its URL for you, and you can provide this URL directly to your router. If your identity provider _doesn't_ do this, you need to create and maintain your own JWKS at an `https://` or `file://` URL that your router can access.

### JWKS format

A JWKS is a JSON object with a single top-level property: `keys`. The value of `keys` is an array of objects that each represent a single JWK:

```json title="jwks.json"
// Abridged example from the JWK specification
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "RSA",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "kid": "abc123",
      "n": "0vx7agoebGcQSuu...", // Shortened for readability
      "e": "AQAB"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each JWK object includes properties that describe the key, such as its algorithm and purpose. Different JWKs can have different properties depending on their type, but these properties can apply to any JWK:

#### Universal JWK properties

<table class="field-table api-ref">

      <th>Option</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `kty`

</td>
<td>

Short for **key type**. The type of cryptographic algorithm that the JWK uses (such as `RSA`).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `alg`

</td>
<td>

The exact cryptographic algorithm to use with the JWK (such as `RS256` or `HS512`).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `kid`

</td>
<td>

Short for **key identifier**. The JWK's unique identifier.

JWTs created with a particular key include that key's identifier in their payload, which enables the router to know which key to use for validation.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="min-width: 150px;">

##### `use`

</td>
<td>

Indicates how the JWK is used. Possible values are `enc` (encryption) and `sig` (signature).

If you're using a key to perform JWT authentication with the Apollo Router, this value should be `sig` (or omitted).

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

### JWK Key Matching

Some Identity Providers (IdPs) don't specify an `alg` or a `kid` for their keys. They will specify a `kty`, since that is mandatory in the JWKS specification..

The router searches through the set of configured JWKSets to find the best matching JWK according to the following criteria:

 1. a matching `kid` and `alg`
 1. a matching `kid` and algorithm `kty`
 1. a matching `alg`
 1. a matching `kty`

The router will thus attempt to verify with the most specific matching key.

## Observability

If your router enables [tracing](./tracing/), the JWT authentication plugin has its own tracing span, named `authentication_plugin`.

If your router enables [metrics collection via Prometheus](./metrics/#using-prometheus), the JWT authentication plugin provides and exports the following metrics:

- `apollo_authentication_failure_count`
- `apollo_authentication_success_count`
- `apollo_authentication_cooldown_count`

Those metrics have the following shapes:

```
# HELP apollo_authentication_failure_count apollo_authentication_failure_count
# TYPE apollo_authentication_failure_count counter
apollo_authentication_failure_count{kind="JWT",service_name="apollo-router"} 1

# HELP apollo_authentication_success_count apollo_authentication_success_count
# TYPE apollo_authentication_success_count counter
apollo_authentication_success_count{kind="JWT",service_name="apollo-router"} 11

# HELP apollo_authentication_cooldown_count apollo_authentication_cooldown_count
# TYPE apollo_authentication_cooldown_count counter
apollo_authentication_cooldown_count{kind="JWT",service_name="apollo-router"} 3
```
