title: Tracing common configuration
---


The Apollo Router supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), with exporters for:

* [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)
* [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/)
* [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
* [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md) over HTTP or gRPC

The Apollo Router generates spans that include the various phases of serving a request and associated dependencies. This is useful for showing how response time is affected by:

* Sub-request response times
* Query shape (sub-request dependencies)
* Apollo Router post-processing

Span data is sent to a collector such as [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), which can assemble spans into a gantt chart for analysis.

> To get the most out of distributed tracing, _all_ components in your system should be instrumented.

## Common configuration

### Service name

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    common:
      # (Optional) Set the service name to easily find traces related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
      service_name: "router"
```

Service name discovery is handled in the following order:
1. `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` env
2. `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` env
3. `router.yaml` `service_name`
4. `router.yaml` `resource`

If none of the above are found then the service name will be set to `unknown_service:apollo_router` or `unknown_service` if the executable name cannot be determined.

### Resource

A Resource is a set of key-value pairs that provide additional global information exported with your traces.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    common:
      resource:
        "environment.name": "production"
        "environment.namespace": "{env.MY_K8_NAMESPACE_ENV_VARIABLE}"
```

> [See OpenTelemetry conventions for resources.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/README.md)

### Sampling

To prevent sending to many traces to your APM you may want to enable sampling.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    common:
      sampler: always_on # (default) all requests are sampled (always_on|always_off|<0.0-1.0>)
      parent_based_sampler: true # (default) If an incoming span has OpenTelemetry headers then the request will always be sampled. 
```

Setting `sampler` to `0.1` will result in only 10% of your requests being sampled.

`parent_based_sampler` enables clients to make the sampling decision. This guarantees that a trace that starts at a client will also have spans at the router. You may wish to turn this off if your router is exposed directly to the internet.

### Propagation

The `propagation` section allows you to configure which propagators are active in addition to those automatically activated by using an exporter.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    propagation:
      # https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/
      baggage: false

      # https://www.datadoghq.com/
      datadog: false

      # https://www.jaegertracing.io/ (compliant with opentracing)
      jaeger: false

      # https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/
      trace_context: false

      # https://zipkin.io/ (compliant with opentracing)
      zipkin: false

      # https://aws.amazon.com/xray/ (compliant with opentracing)
      aws_xray: false

      # If you have your own way to generate a trace id and you want to pass it via a custom request header
      request:
        header_name: my-trace-id
```

Specifying explicit propagation is generally only required if you're using an exporter that supports multiple trace ID formats (e.g., OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, or OpenTracing compatible exporters).

### Span limits

You may set limits on spans to prevent sending too much data to your APM.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    common:

      # Optional limits
      max_attributes_per_event: 10
      max_attributes_per_link: 10
      max_attributes_per_span: 10
      max_events_per_span: 10
      max_links_per_span: 10
```

## Trace ID

> This is part of an experimental feature, it means any time until it's stabilized (without the prefix `experimental_`) we might change the configuration shape or adding/removing features.
> If you want to give feedback or participate in that feature feel free to join [this discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/2147).

If you want to expose in response headers the generated trace ID or the one you provided using propagation headers you can use this configuration:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    experimental_response_trace_id:
      enabled: true # default: false
      header_name: "my-trace-id" # default: "apollo-trace-id"
```

Using this configuration you will have a response header called `my-trace-id` containing the trace ID. It could help you to debug a specific query if you want to grep your log with this trace id to have more context.

## Batch Processor

All trace exporters (apollo|datadog|zipkin|jaeger|otlp) have batch span processor configuration, it will be necessary to tune this if you see the following in your logs:

`OpenTelemetry trace error occurred: cannot send span to the batch span processor because the channel is full`

* **scheduled_delay** The delay from receiving the first span to the batch being sent.
* **max_concurrent_exports** The maximum number of overlapping export requests. For instance if ingest is taking a long time to respond there may be several overlapping export requests.
* **max_export_batch_size** The number of spans to include in a batch. Your ingest may have max message size limits.
* **max_export_timeout** The timeout for sending spans before dropping the data.
* **max_queue_size** The maximum number of spans to be buffered before dropping span data.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  # Apollo tracing
  apollo:
    batch_processor:
      scheduled_delay: 100ms
      max_concurrent_exports: 1000
      max_export_batch_size: 10000
      max_export_timeout: 100s
      max_queue_size: 10000

  tracing:
    # Datadog
    datadog:
      enabled: true
      batch_processor:
        scheduled_delay: 100ms
        max_concurrent_exports: 1000
        max_export_batch_size: 10000
        max_export_timeout: 100s
        max_queue_size: 10000
      endpoint: default
    # Jaeger
    # Otlp
    # Zipkin
```
