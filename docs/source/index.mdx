**The Apollo Router** is a configurable, high-performance router for your federated GraphQL API (also known as a [supergraph](/graphos/graphs/#self-hosted-supergraphs)):

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["<b>Apollo Router</b>"]);
  serviceB[Products<br/>API];
  serviceC[Reviews<br/>API];
  router -->|Sub-query| serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.->|Query| router;
  class clients secondary;
```

The Apollo Router intelligently distributes inbound queries across your GraphQL-powered microservices, enabling clients to fetch data from multiple sources with a single request.

> Learn about the [distinction between the Apollo Router and API gateways](/technotes/TN0037-api-gateways/).

If you have an existing federated graph that currently uses `@apollo/gateway`, you can move to the Apollo Router without changing any other part of your graph.

> **This documentation helps you run a _self-hosted_ instance of the Apollo Router.** If you [create a cloud supergraph](/graphos/quickstart/cloud/) with Apollo GraphOS, Apollo provisions and hosts your router for you.
>
> Cloud supergraphs are recommended for organizations that don't need to host their router in their own infrastructure.
