## Standard metric instruments

GraphOS Router and Apollo Router Core provide a set of standard router instruments that expose detailed information about the router's request lifecycle. You can consume the metrics they capture by configuring a [metrics exporter](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/metrics/overview).

Standard router instruments are different than OpenTelemetry (OTel) instruments or custom instruments:

- Router instruments provide standard metrics about the router request lifeycle and have names starting with `apollo.router` or `apollo_router`.
- OTel instruments provide metrics about the HTTP lifecycle and have names starting with `http`.
- Custom instruments provide customized metrics about the router request lifecycle.

The rest of this reference lists the available standard router instruments.

### GraphQL

- `apollo.router.graphql_error` - counts GraphQL errors in responses, attributes:
  - `code`: error code

### Session

- `apollo.router.session.count.active` - Number of in-flight GraphQL requests

### Cache

- `apollo.router.cache.size` â€” Number of entries in the cache
- `apollo.router.cache.hit.time` - Time to hit the cache in seconds
- `apollo.router.cache.hit.time.count` - Number of cache hits
- `apollo.router.cache.miss.time` - Time to miss the cache in seconds
- `apollo.router.cache.miss.time.count` - Number of cache misses
- `apollo.router.cache.storage.estimated_size` - The estimated storage size of the cache in bytes (query planner in memory only).

All cache metrics listed above have the following attributes:

- `kind`: the cache being queried (`apq`, `query planner`, `introspection`)
- `storage`: The backend storage of the cache (`memory`, `redis`)

### Coprocessor

- `apollo.router.operations.coprocessor.total` - Total operations with coprocessors enabled.
- `apollo.router.operations.coprocessor.duration` - Time spent waiting for the coprocessor to answer, in seconds.

The coprocessor operations metric has the following attributes:

- `coprocessor.stage`: string (`RouterRequest`, `RouterResponse`, `SubgraphRequest`, `SubgraphResponse`)
- `coprocessor.succeeded`: bool

### Performance

- `apollo_router_schema_load_duration` - Time spent loading the schema in seconds.

### Query planning

- `apollo.router.query_planning.warmup.duration` - Time spent warming up the query planner queries in seconds.
- `apollo.router.query_planning.plan.duration` - Histogram of plan durations isolated to query planning time only.
- `apollo.router.query_planning.total.duration` - Histogram of plan durations including queue time.
- `apollo.router.query_planning.queued` - When the legacy planner is used, a gauge of the number of queued plans requests.
- `apollo.router.query_planning.plan.evaluated_plans` - Histogram of the number of evaluated query plans.
- `apollo.router.v8.heap.used` - heap memory used by V8, in bytes.
- `apollo.router.v8.heap.total` - total heap allocated by V8, in bytes.

### Compute jobs

- `apollo.router.compute_jobs.queued` - A gauge of the number of jobs queued for the thread pool dedicated to CPU-heavy components like GraphQL parsing and validation, and the (new) query planner.
- `apollo.router.compute_jobs.queue_is_full` - A counter of requests rejected because the queue was full

### Uplink

<Tip>

[Learn more about Apollo Uplink.](/federation/managed-federation/uplink/)

</Tip>

- `apollo_router_uplink_fetch_duration_seconds` - Uplink request duration, attributes:
  - `url`: The Uplink URL that was polled
  - `query`: The query that the router sent to Uplink (`SupergraphSdl` or `License`)
  - `kind`: (`new`, `unchanged`, `http_error`, `uplink_error`)
  - `code`: The error code depending on type (if an error occurred)
  - `error`: The error message (if an error occurred)
- `apollo_router_uplink_fetch_count_total`
  - `status`: (`success`, `failure`)
  - `query`: The query that the router sent to Uplink (`SupergraphSdl` or `License`)

<Note>

The initial call to Uplink during router startup is not reflected in metrics.

</Note>

### Subscriptions

<Tip>

[Learn more about subscriptions.](/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/)

</Tip>

- `apollo.router.opened.subscriptions` - Number of different opened subscriptions (not the number of clients with an opened subscriptions in case it's deduplicated)
- `apollo.router.skipped.event.count` - Number of subscription events that has been skipped because too many events have been received from the subgraph but not yet sent to the client.

### Batching

- `apollo.router.operations.batching` - A counter of the number of query batches received by the router.
- `apollo.router.operations.batching.size` - A histogram tracking the number of queries contained within a query batch.

### GraphOS Studio

- `apollo.router.telemetry.studio.reports` - The number of reports submitted to GraphOS Studio by the router.
  - `report.type`: The type of report submitted: "traces" or "metrics"
  - `report.protocol`: Either "apollo" or "otlp", depending on the otlp_tracing_sampler configuration.

### Telemetry

- `apollo.router.telemetry.batch_processor.errors` - The number of errors encountered by exporter batch processors.
  - `name`: One of `apollo-tracing`, `datadog-tracing`, `jaeger-collector`, `otlp-tracing`, `zipkin-tracing`.
  - `error` = One of `channel closed`, `channel full`.
