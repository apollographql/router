---

> Before consulting this reference, make sure you've read [Rhai scripts for the Apollo Router](./rhai/).

This article documents symbols and behaviors that are specific to [Rhai customizations](./rhai/) for the Apollo Router. To learn the basics of the Rhai scripting language, see [the Rhai documentation](https://rhai.rs/book/index.html).

## Entry point hooks

Your Rhai script's [main file](./rhai/#the-main-file) hooks into the individual services of the Apollo Router's [request-handling pipeline](./overview/#how-customizations-work). To do so, it defines whichever combination of the following entry point hooks it requires:

```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {}
fn execution_service(service) {}
fn subgraph_service(service, subgraph) {}
```

Within each hook, you define custom logic to interact with the current active request and/or response as needed. This most commonly involves using methods of the provided `service` object to [register service callbacks](./rhai/#service-callbacks), like so:

```rhai title="main.rhai"
fn supergraph_service(service) {
  let request_callback = |request| {
      print("Supergraph service: Client request received");
  };
  
  let response_callback = |response| {
      print("Supergraph service: Client response ready to send");
  };

  service.map_request(request_callback);
  service.map_response(response_callback);
}
```

## Logging

If your script logs a message with Rhai's built-in `print()` function, it's logged to the Apollo Router's logs at the "info" level:

```rhai
print("logged at the info level");
```

For more control over a message's log level, you can use the following functions:

```rhai
log_error("error-level log message");
log_warn("warn-level log message");
log_info("info-level log message");
log_debug("debug-level log message");
log_trace("trace-level log message");
```

## Terminating client requests

Your Rhai script can terminate the associated client request that triggered it. To do so, it throws an exception. This returns an `Internal Server Error` to the client with a `500` response code.

For example:
```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    // Define a closure to process our response
    let f = |response| {
        // Something goes wrong during response processing...
        throw "An error occurred setting up the supergraph_service...";
    };
    // Map our response using our closure
    service.map_response(f);
}
```

If you wish to have more control over the HTTP status code returned to the client, then you can throw an error which is an objectmap with keys: status and message.

The key must be a number and the message must be something which can be converted to a string.

For example:
```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    // Define a closure to process our response
    let f = |response| {
        // Something goes wrong during response processing...
        throw #{
            status: 400,
            message: "An error occurred processing the response..."
        };
    };
    // Map our response using our closure
    service.map_response(f);
}
```

If the supplied status code is not a valid HTTP status code, then a `500` response code will result.

Returning a `200` "error" is not currently supported. If encountered, it will be silently converted into a `500` error. We may relax this restriction in the future.

## Timing execution

Your Rhai customization can use the global `apollo_start` constant to calculate durations. This is similar to `Epoch` in Unix environments.

```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    // Define a closure to process our response
    let f = |response| {
        // highlight-start
        let start = apollo_start.elapsed;
        // Do some processing here...
        let duration = apollo_start.elapsed - start;
        print(`response processing took: ${duration}`);
        // highlight-end

        // Log out any errors we may have
        print(response.body.errors);
    };
    // Map our response using our closure
    service.map_response(f);
}
```

## Accessing the SDL

Your Rhai customization can use the global `apollo_sdl` constant to examine the supergraph.

```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    print(`${apollo_sdl}`);
}
```

## Accessing a TraceId

Your Rhai customization can use the function `traceid()` to retrieve an opentelemetry span id. This will throw an exception if a span is not available, so always handle exceptions when using this function.

```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    try {
        let id = traceid();
        print(`id: ${id}`);
    }
    catch(err)
    {
        // log any errors
        log_error(`span id error: ${err}`);
    }
}
```

## url encode/decode strings

Your Rhai customization can use the functions `urlencode()` and `urldecode()` to encode/decode strings. `encode()` does not fail, but `decode()` can fail, so always handle exceptions when using the `decode()` function.

```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    let original = "alice and bob";
    let encoded = urlencode(original);
    // encoded will be "alice%20and%20bob"
    try {
        let and_back = urldecode(encoded);
        // and_back will be "alice and bob"
    }
    catch(err)
    {
        // log any errors
        log_error(`urldecode error: ${err}`);
    }
}
```

## base64 encode/decode strings

Your Rhai customization can use the functions `base64::encode()` and `base64::decode()` to encode/decode strings. `encode()` does not fail, but `decode()` can fail, so always handle exceptions when using the `decode()` function.

```rhai
fn supergraph_service(service) {
    let original = "alice and bob";
    let encoded = base64::encode(original);
    // encoded will be "YWxpY2UgYW5kIGJvYgo="
    try {
        let and_back = base64::decode(encoded);
        // and_back will be "alice and bob"
    }
    catch(err)
    {
        // log any errors
        log_error(`base64::decode error: ${err}`);
    }
}
```

Note: You don't need to import the "base64" module. It is imported in the router.

### Headers with multiple values

The simple get/set api for dealing with single value headers is sufficient for most use cases. If you wish to set multiple values on a key then you should do this by supplying an array of values.

If you wish to get multiple values for a header key, then you must use the `values()` fn, NOT the indexed accessor. If you do use the indexed accessor, it will only return the first value (as a string) associated with the key.

Look at the examples to see how this works in practice.

## `Request` interface

All callback functions registered via `map_request` are passed a `request` object that represents the request sent by the client. This object provides the following fields, any of which a callback can modify in-place (read-write):

```
request.context
request.headers
request.body.query
request.body.operation_name
request.body.variables
request.body.extensions
request.uri.host
request.uri.path
```

**For `subgraph_service` callbacks only,** the `request` object provides _additional_ fields for interacting with the request that will be sent to the corresponding subgraph:

```
request.subgraph.headers
request.subgraph.body.query
request.subgraph.body.operation_name
request.subgraph.body.variables
request.subgraph.body.extensions
request.subgraph.uri.host
request.subgraph.uri.path
```

These additional fields are shared across all subgraph invocations and are thus read-only.

### `request.context`

The context is a generic key/value store that exists for the entire lifespan of a particular client request. You can use this to share information between multiple callbacks throughout the request's lifespan.

Keys must be strings, but values can be any Rhai object.

For more information, see [Define necessary context](./native#5-define-necessary-context).

```rhai
// You can interact with request.context as an indexed variable
request.context["contextual"] = 42; // Adds value 42 to the context with key "contextual"
print(`${request.context["contextual"]}`); // Writes 42 to the router log at info level
// Rhai also supports extended dot notation for indexed variables, so this is equivalent
request.context.contextual = 42;
```

#### `upsert()`

The context provides an `upsert()` function for resolving situations where one of an update _or_ an insert is required when setting the value for a particular key.

To use `upsert()`, you define a callback function that receives a key's existing value (if any) and makes changes as required before returning the final value to set.

```rhai
// Get a reference to a cache-key
let my_cache_key = response.headers["cache-key"];

// Define an upsert resolver callback
// The `current` parameter is the current value for the specified key.
// This particular callback checks whether `current` is an ObjectMap 
// (default is the unit value of ()). If not, assign an empty ObjectMap.
// Finally, update the stored ObjectMap with our subgraph name as key
// and the returned cache-key as a value.
let resolver = |current| {
  if current == () {
      // No map found. Create an empty object map
      current = #{};
  }
  // Update our object map with a key and value
  current[subgraph] = my_cache_key;
  return current;
};

// Upsert our context with our resolver
response.context.upsert("surrogate-cache-key", resolver);
```

### `request.headers`

The headers of a request are accessible as a read/write indexed variable. The keys and values must be valid header name and value strings.

```rhai
// You can interact with request.headers as an indexed variable
request.headers["x-my-new-header"] = 42.to_string(); // Inserts a new header "x-my-new-header" with value "42"
print(`${request.headers["x-my-new-header"]}`); // Writes "42" into the router log at info level
// Rhai also supports extended dot notation for indexed variables, so this is equivalent
request.headers.x-my-new-header = 42.to_string();
// You can also set an header value from an array. Useful with the "set-cookie" header,
// Note: It's probably more useful to do this on response headers. Simply illustrating the syntax here.
request.headers["set-cookie"] = [
  "foo=bar; Domain=localhost; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 04 Jan 2023 17:25:27 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None",
  "foo2=bar2; Domain=localhost; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 04 Jan 2023 17:25:27 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None",
];
// You can also get multiple header values for a header using the values() fn
// Note: It's probably more useful to do this on response headers. Simply illustrating the syntax here.
print(`${request.headers.values("set-cookie")}`);
```

### `request.body.query`

This is the client-provided GraphQL operation string to execute.

To modify this value _before_ query planning occurs, you must do so within a `supergraph_service()` request callback. If you modify it later, the query plan is generated using the original provided operation string.

The following example modifies an incoming query and transforms it into a completely invalid query:

```rhai
print(`${request.body.query}`); // Log the query string before modification
request.body.query="query invalid { _typnam }}"; // Update the query string (in this case to an invalid query)
print(`${request.body.query}`); // Log the query string after modification
```

### `request.body.operation_name`

This is the name of the GraphQL operation to execute, if a name is provided in the request. This value _must_ be present if `request.body.query` contains more than one operation definition.

For an example of interacting with `operation_name`, see the [examples/op-name-to-header directory](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples/op-name-to-header).

```rhai
print(`${request.body.operation_name}`); // Log the operation_name before modification
request.body.operation_name +="-my-suffix"; // Append "-my-suffix" to the operation_name
print(`${request.body.operation_name}`); // Log the operation_name after modification
```

### `request.body.variables`

These are the values of any GraphQL variables provided for the operation. They are exposed to Rhai as an [Object Map](https://rhai.rs/book/language/object-maps.html).

```rhai
print(`${request.body.variables}`); // Log all GraphQL variables
```

### `request.body.extensions`

Request extensions may be read or modified. They are exposed to Rhai as an [Object Map](https://rhai.rs/book/language/object-maps.html).

```rhai
print(`${request.body.extensions}`); // Log all extensions
```

### `request.uri.host`

This is the host component of the request's URI, as a string.

Modifying this value for a client request has no effect, because the request has already reached the router. However, modifying `request.subgraph.uri.host` in a `subgraph_service` callback _does_ modify the URI that the router uses to communicate with the corresponding subgraph.

```rhai
print(`${request.uri.host}`); // Log the request host
```

### `request.uri.path`

This is the path component of the request's URI, as a string.

Modifying this value for a client request has no effect, because the request has already reached the router. However, modifying `request.subgraph.uri.path` in a `subgraph_service` callback _does_ modify the URI that the router uses to communicate with the corresponding subgraph.

```rhai
print(`${request.uri.path}`); // log the request path
request.uri.path += "/added-context"; // Add an extra element to the query path
```

### `request.subgraph.*`

The `request.subgraph` object is available _only_ for `map_request` callbacks registered in `subgraph_service`. This object has the exact same fields as `request` itself, but these fields apply to the HTTP request that the router will send to the corresponding subgraph.

```rhai
// You can interact with request.subgraph.headers as an indexed variable
request.subgraph.headers["x-my-new-header"] = 42.to_string(); // Inserts a new header "x-my-new-header" with value "42"
print(`${request.subgraph.headers["x-my-new-header"]}`); // Writes "42" into the router log at info level
// Rhai also supports extended dot notation for indexed variables, so this is equivalent
request.subgraph.headers.x-my-new-header = 42.to_string();
```

## `Response` interface

All callback functions registered via `map_response` are passed a `response` object that represents an HTTP response.

* For callbacks in `subgraph_service`, this object represents the response sent to the router by the corresponding subgraph.
* In all other services, this object represents the response that the router will send to the requesting client.

The `response` object includes the following fields:

```
response.context
response.headers
response.body.label
response.body.data
response.body.errors
response.body.extensions
```

All of the above fields are read/write.

The following fields are identical in behavior to their `request` counterparts:

* [`context`](#requestcontext)
* [`headers`](#requestheaders)
* [`body.extensions`](#requestbodyextensions)

Other fields are described below.

### `response.body.label`

A response may contain a label and this may be read/written as a string.

```rhai
print(`${response.body.label}`); // logs the response label
```

### `response.body.data`

A response may contain data (some responses with errors do not contain data). Be careful when manipulating data (and errors) to make sure that response remain valid. `data` is exposed to Rhai as an [Object Map](https://rhai.rs/book/language/object-maps.html).

There is a complete example of interacting with the response data in the [examples/data-response-mutate directory](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples/data-response-mutate).

```rhai
print(`${response.body.data}`); // logs the response data
```

### `response.body.errors`

A response may contain errors. Errors are represented in rhai as an array of Object Maps.

Each Error must contain at least:
 - a message (String)
 - a location (Array)

(The location can be an empty array.)

Optionally, an error may also contain extensions, which are represented as an Object Map.

There is a complete example of interacting with the response errors in the [examples/error-response-mutate directory](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/examples/error-response-mutate).

```rhai
// Create an error with our message
let error_to_add = #{
    message: "this is an added error",
    locations: [],
    // Extensions are optional, adding some arbitrary extensions to illustrate syntax
    extensions: #{
        field_1: "field 1",
        field_2: "field_2"
    }
};
// Add this error to any existing errors
response.body.errors += error_to_add;
print(`${response.body.errors}`); // logs the response errors
```
