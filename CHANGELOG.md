# [x.x.x] (unreleased) - 2021-mm-dd

 - **❗ BREAKING ❗**
 -  **use ControlFlow in checkpoints** ([PR #602](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/602))
   `checkpoint` and `async_checkpoint` now `use std::ops::ControlFlow instead` of the `Step` enum. ControlFlow has two variants, `Continue` and `Break`.
 
## ❗ BREAKING ❗
- **Header propagation plugin** ([PR #599](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/599))

  Header manipulation has been shifted to a plugin rather than service level layers. It now supports rules for all 
  subgraphs as wel as individual subgraphs.

  ```yaml
  plugins:
    headers:
      all:
      - propagate:
        matching: "aaa.*"
      - propagate:
        named: "bbb"
        default: "def"
        rename: "ccc"
      - insert:
        name: "ddd"
        value: "eee"
      - remove:
        matching: "fff.*"
      - remove:
        name: "ggg"
      subgraphs:
        products:
        - propagate:
          matching: ".*"
    ```
- **Remove configurable layers** ([PR #603](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/603))

  Having plugins and layers as configurable items in yaml was creating confusion as to when it was appropriate to
use a layer vs a plugin. As the layer API is a subset of the plugin API the layer option has been removed.

# [v0.1.0-alpha.8] 2022-03-08

## :sparkles: Features

- **Request lifecycle checkpoints** ([PR #558](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/548) and [PR #580](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/548))

    Checkpoints in the request pipeline now allow plugin authors (which includes us!) to check conditions during a request's lifecycle and circumvent further execution if desired.
    
    Using `Step` return types within the checkpoint it's possible to influence what happens (including changing things like the HTTP status code, etc.).  A caching layer, for example, could return `Step::Return(response)` if a cache "hit" occurred and `Step::Continue(request)` (to allow normal processing to continue) in the event of a cache "miss".
    
    These can be either synchronous or asynchronous.  To see examples, see:
    
    - A [synchronous example](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/190afe181bf2c50be1761b522fcbdcc82b81d6ca/examples/forbid-anonymous-operations)
    - An [asynchronous example](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/190afe181bf2c50be1761b522fcbdcc82b81d6ca/examples/async-allow-client-id)

- **Contracts support** ([PR #573](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/573))

  The Apollo Router now supports [Apollo Studio Contracts](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/contracts/)!

- **Add OpenTracing support** ([PR #548](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/548))

  OpenTracing support has been added into the reporting plugin.  You're now able to have span propagation (via headers) via two common formats supported by the `opentracing` crate: `zipkin_b3` and `jaeger`.


## :bug: Fixes

- **Configuration no longer requires `router_url`** ([PR #553](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/553))

  When using Managed Federation or directly providing a Supergraph file, it is no longer necessary to provide a `routing_url` value.  Instead, the values provided by the Supergraph or Studio will be used and the `routing_url` can be used only to override specific URLs for specific subgraphs.

- **Fix plugin ordering** ([PR #559](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/559))

  Plugins need to execute in sequence of declaration *except* for certain "core" plugins (e.g., reporting) which must execute early in the plugin sequence to make sure they are in place as soon as possible in the Router lifecycle. This change now ensures that the reporting plugin executes first and that all other plugins are executed in the order of declaration in configuration.

- **Propagate Router operation lifecycle errors** ([PR #537](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/537))

  Our recent extension rework was missing a key part: Error propagation and handling! This change makes sure errors that occurred during query planning and query execution will be displayed as GraphQL errors instead of an empty payload.


# [v0.1.0-alpha.7] 2022-02-25

## :sparkles: Features

- **Apollo Studio Explorer landing page** ([PR #526](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/526))

  We've replaced the _redirect_ to Apollo Studio with a statically rendered landing page.  This supersedes the previous redirect approach was merely introduced as a short-cut.  The experience now duplicates the user-experience which exists in Apollo Gateway today.

  It is also possible to _save_ the redirect preference and make the behavior sticky for future visits.  As a bonus, this also resolves the failure to preserve the correct HTTP scheme (e.g., `https://`) in the event that the Apollo Router was operating behind a TLS-terminating proxy, since the redirect is now handled client-side.

  Overall, this should be a more durable and more transparent experience for the user.

- **Display Apollo Router version on startup** ([PR #543](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/543))
  The Apollo Router displays its version on startup from now on, which will come in handy when debugging/observing how your application behaves.

## :bug: Fixes

- **Passing a `--supergraph` file supersedes Managed Federation** ([PR #535](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/535))

  The `--supergraph` flag will no longer be silently ignored when the Supergraph is already being provided through [Managed Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/overview) (i.e., when the `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variables are set).  This allows temporarily overriding the Supergraph schema that is fetched from Apollo Studio's Uplink endpoint, while still reporting metrics to Apollo Studio reporting ingress.

- **Anonymous operation names are now empty in tracing** ([PR #525](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/525))

  When GraphQL operation names are not necessary to execute an operation (i.e., when there is only a single operation in a GraphQL document) and the GraphQL operation is _not_ named (i.e., it is anonymous), the `operation_name` attribute on the trace spans that are associated with the request will no longer contain a single hyphen character (`-`) but will instead be an empty string.  This matches the way that these operations are represented during the GraphQL operation's life-cycle as well.

- **Resolved missing documentation in Apollo Explorer** ([PR #540](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/540))

   We've resolved a scenario that prevented Apollo Explorer from displaying documentation by adding support for a new introspection query which also queries for deprecation (i.e., `includeDeprecated`) on `input` arguments.
  
# [v0.1.0-alpha.6] 2022-02-18

## :sparkles: Features

- **Apollo Studio Managed Federation support** ([PR #498](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/498))

  [Managed Federation]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/overview/

  The Router can now automatically download and check for updates on its schema from Studio (via [Uplink])'s free, [Managed Federation] service.  This is configured in the same way as Apollo Gateway via the `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variables, in the same way as was true in Apollo Gateway ([seen here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/setup/#4-connect-the-gateway-to-studio)). This will also enable operation usage reporting.

  > **Note:** It is not yet possible to configure the Router with [`APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT`].  If you need this behavior, please open a feature request with your use case.

  [`APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT`]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/uplink/#environment-variable
  [Uplink]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/uplink/
  [operation usage reporting]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/metrics/usage-reporting/#pushing-metrics-from-apollo-server

- **Subgraph header configuration** ([PR #453](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/453))

  The Router now supports passing both client-originated and router-originated headers to specific subgraphs using YAML configuration.  Each subgraph which needs to receive headers can specify which headers (or header patterns) should be forwarded to which subgraph.

  More information can be found in our documentation on [subgraph header configuration].

  At the moment, when using using YAML configuration alone, router-originated headers can only be static strings (e.g., `sent-from-apollo-router: true`).  If you have use cases for deriving headers in the router dynamically, please open or find a feature request issue on the repository which explains the use case.

  [subgraph header configuration]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#configuring-headers-received-by-subgraphs

- **In-flight subgraph `query` de-duplication** ([PR #285](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/285))

  As a performance booster to both the Router and the subgraphs it communicates with, the Router will now _de-duplicate_ multiple _identical_ requests to subgraphs when there are multiple in-flight requests to the same subgraph with the same `query` (**never** `mutation`s), headers, and GraphQL `variables`.  Instead, a single request will be made to the subgraph and the many client requests will be served via that single response.

  There may be a substantial drop in number of requests observed by subgraphs with this release.

- **Operations can now be made via `GET` requests** ([PR #429](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/429))

  The Router now supports `GET` requests for `query` operations.  Previously, the Apollo Router only supported making requests via `POST` requests.  We've always intended on supporting `GET` support, but needed some additional support in place to make sure we could prevent allowing `mutation`s to happen over `GET` requests.

- **Automatic persisted queries (APQ) support** ([PR #433](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/433))

  The Router now handles [automatic persisted queries (APQ)] by default, as was previously the case in Apollo Gateway.  APQ support pairs really well with `GET` requests (which also landed in this release) since they allow read operations (e.g., `GET` requests) to be more easily cached by intermediary proxies and CDNs, which typically forbid caching `POST` requests by specification (even if they often are just reads in GraphQL).  Follow the link above to the documentation to test them out.

  [automatic persisted queries (APQ)]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/

- **New internal Tower architecture and preparation for extensibility** ([PR #319](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/319))

  We've introduced new foundational primitives to the Router's request pipeline which facilitate the creation of composable _onion layers_.  For now, this is largely leveraged through a series of internal refactors and we'll need to document and expand on more of the details that facilitate developers building their own custom extensions.  To leverage existing art &mdash; and hopefully maximize compatibility and facilitate familiarity &mdash; we've leveraged the [Tokio Tower `Service`] pattern.

  This should facilitate a number of interesting extension opportunities and we're excited for what's in-store next.  We intend on improving and iterating on the API's ergonomics for common Graph Router behaviors over time, and we'd encourage you to open issues on the repository with use-cases you might think need consideration.

  [Tokio Tower `Service`]: https://docs.rs/tower/latest/tower/trait.Service.html

- **Support for Jaeger HTTP collector in OpenTelemetry** ([PR #479](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/479))

  It is now possible to configure Jaeger HTTP collector endpoints within the `opentelemetry` configuration.  Previously, Router only supported the UDP method.

  The [documentation] has also been updated to demonstrate how this can be configured.

  [documentation]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#using-jaeger

## :bug: Fixes

- **Studio agent collector now binds to localhost** [PR #486](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pulls/486)

  The Studio agent collector will bind to `127.0.0.1`.  It can be configured to bind to `0.0.0.0` if desired (e.g., if you're using the collector to collect centrally) by using the [`spaceport.listener` property] in the documentation.

  [`spaceport.listener` property]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#spaceport-configuration

# [v0.1.0-alpha.5] 2022-02-15

## :sparkles: Features

- **Apollo Studio usage reporting agent and operation-level reporting** ([PR #309](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pulls/309), [PR #420](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pulls/420))

  While there are several levels of Apollo Studio integration, the initial phase of our Apollo Studio reporting focuses on operation-level reporting.

  At a high-level, this will allow Apollo Studio to have visibility into some basic schema details, like graph ID and variant, and per-operation details, including:
  
  - Overall operation latency
  - The number of times the operation is executed
  - [Client awareness] reporting, which leverages the `apollographql-client-*` headers to give visibility into _which clients are making which operations_.

  This should enable several Apollo Studio features including the _Clients_ and _Checks_ pages as well as the _Checks_ tab on the _Operations_ page.
  
  > *Note:* As a current limitation, the _Fields_ page will not have detailed field-based metrics and on the _Operations_ page the _Errors_ tab, the _Traces_ tab and the _Error Percentage_ graph will not receive data.  We recommend configuring the Router's [OpenTelemetry tracing] with your APM provider and using distributed tracing to increase visibility into individual resolver performance.

  Overall, this marks a notable but still incremental progress toward more of the Studio integrations which are laid out in [#66](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/66).

  [Client awareness]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/metrics/client-awareness/
  [Schema checks]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/schema-checks/
  [OpenTelemetry tracing]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#tracing

- **Complete GraphQL validation** ([PR #471](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/471) via [federation-rs#37](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-rs/pull/37))

  We now apply all of the standard validations which are defined in the `graphql` (JavaScript) implementation's default set of "[specified rules]" during query planning.

  [specified rules]: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/95dac43fd4bff037e06adaa7cfb44f497bca94a7/src/validation/specifiedRules.ts#L76-L103

## :bug: Fixes

- **No more double `http://http://` in logs** ([PR #448](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pulls/448))

  The server logs will no longer advertise the listening host and port with a doubled-up `http://` prefix.  You can once again click happily into Studio Explorer!

- **Improved handling of Federation 1 supergraphs** ([PR #446](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/446) via [federation#1511](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/1511))

  Our partner team has improved the handling of Federation 1 supergraphs in the implementation of Federation 2 alpha (which the Router depends on and is meant to offer compatibility with Federation 1 in most cases).  We've updated our query planner implementation to the version with the fixes.

  This also was the first time that we've leveraged the new [`federation-rs`] repository to handle our bridge, bringing a huge developmental advantage to teams working across the various concerns!

  [`federation-rs`]: https://github.com/apollographql/federation-rs

- **Resolved incorrect subgraph ordering during merge** ([PR #460](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/460))

  A fix was applied to fix the behavior which was identified in [Issue #451] which was caused by a misconfigured filter which was being applied to field paths.

  [Issue #451]: https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/451
# [v0.1.0-alpha.4] 2022-02-03

## :sparkles: Features

- **Unix socket support** via [#158](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/158)

  _...and via upstream [`tokios-rs/tokio#4385`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/4385)_

  The Router can now listen on Unix domain sockets (i.e., IPC) in addition to the existing IP-based (port) listening.  This should bring further compatibility with upstream intermediaries who also allow support this form of communication!

  _(Thank you to [@cecton](https://github.com/cecton), both for the PR that landed this feature but also for contributing the upstream PR to `tokio`.)_

## :bug: Fixes

- **Resolved hangs occurring on Router reload when `jaeger` was configured** via [#337](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/337)

  Synchronous calls being made to [`opentelemetry::global::set_tracer_provider`] were causing the runtime to misbehave when the configuration (file) was adjusted (and thus, hot-reloaded) on account of the root context of that call being asynchronous.

  This change adjusts the call to be made from a new thread.  Since this only affected _potential_ runtime configuration changes (again, hot-reloads on a configuration change), the thread spawn is  a reasonable solution.

  [`opentelemetry::global::set_tracer_provider`]: https://docs.rs/opentelemetry/0.10.0/opentelemetry/global/fn.set_tracer_provider.html

## :nail_care: Improvements

> Most of the improvements this time are internal to the code-base but that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about them.  A great developer experience matters both internally and externally! :smile_cat:

- **Store JSON strings in a `bytes::Bytes` instance** via [#284](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/284)

  The router does a a fair bit of deserialization, filtering, aggregation and re-serializing of JSON objects.  Since we currently operate on a dynamic schema, we've been relying on [`serde_json::Value`] to represent this data internally.

  After this change, that `Value` type is now replaced with an equivalent type from a new [`serde_json_bytes`], which acts as an envelope around an underlying `bytes::Bytes`.  This allows us to refer to the buffer that contained the JSON data while avoiding the allocation and copying costs on each string for values that are largely unused by the Router directly.

  This should offer future benefits when implementing &mdash; e.g., query de-duplication and caching &mdash; since a single buffer will be usable by multiple responses at the same time.

  [`serde_json::Value`]: https://docs.rs/serde_json/0.9.8/serde_json/enum.Value.html
  [`serde_json_bytes`]: https://crates.io/crates/serde_json_bytes
  [`bytes::Bytes`]: https://docs.rs/bytes/0.4.12/bytes/struct.Bytes.html

-  **Development workflow improvement** via [#367](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/367)

   Polished away some existing _Problems_ reported by `rust-analyzer` and added troubleshooting instructions to our documentation.

- **Removed unnecessary `Arc` from `PreparedQuery`'s `execute`** via [#328](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/328)

  _...and followed up with [#367](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/367)_

- **Bumped/upstream improvements to `test_span`** via [#359](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/359)

  _...and [`apollographql/test-span#11`](https://github.com/apollographql/test-span/pull/11) upstream_

  Internally, this is just a version bump to the Router, but it required upstream changes to the `test-span` crate.  The bump brings new filtering abilities and adjusts the verbosity of spans tracing levels, and removes non-determinism from tests.

# [v0.1.0-alpha.3] 2022-01-11

## :rocket::waxing_crescent_moon: Public alpha release

> An alpha or beta release is in volatile, active development. The release might not be feature-complete, and breaking API changes are possible between individual versions.

## :sparkles: Features

- Trace sampling [#228](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/228): Tracing each request can be expensive. The router now supports sampling, which allows us to only send a fraction of the received requests.

- Health check [#54](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/54)

## :bug: Fixes

- Schema parse errors [#136](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/136): The router wouldn't display what went wrong when parsing an invalid Schema. It now displays exactly where a the parsing error occured, and why.

- Various tracing and telemetry fixes [#237](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/237): The router wouldn't display what went wrong when parsing an invalid Schema. It now displays exactly where a the parsing error occured, and why.

- Query variables validation [#62](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/62): Now that we have a schema parsing feature, we can validate the variables and their types against the schemas and queries.

This release focuses on documentation and bug fixes, stay tuned for the next releases!

## :bug: Fixes

- Handle commas in the @join\_\_graph directive parameters [#101](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/101)

There are several accepted syntaxes to define @join\_\_graph parameters. While we did handle whitespace separated parameters such as `@join__graph(name: "accounts" url: "http://accounts/graphql")`for example, we discarded the url in`@join__graph(name: "accounts", url: "http://accounts/graphql")` (notice the comma). This pr fixes that.

- Invert subgraph URL override logic [#135](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/135)

Subservices endpoint URLs can both be defined in `supergraph.graphql` and in the subgraphs section of the `configuration.yml` file. The configuration now correctly overrides the supergraph endpoint definition when applicable.

- Parse OTLP endpoint address [#156](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/156)

The router OpenTelemetry configuration only supported full URLs (that contain a scheme) while OpenTelemtry collectors support full URLs and endpoints, defaulting to `https`. This pull request fixes that.

## :books: Documentation

A lot of configuration examples and links have been fixed ([#117](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/117), [#120](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/120), [#133](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/133))

## :sparkles: Features

- **Federation 2 alpha**

  The Apollo Router supports the new alpha features of [Apollo Federation 2], including its improved shared ownership model and enhanced type merging.  As new Federation 2 features are released, we will update the Router to bring in that new functionality.
  
  [Apollo Federation 2]: https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/backend/announcing-federation-2/

- **Supergraph support**

  The Apollo Router supports supergraphs that are published to the Apollo Registry, or those that are composed locally.  Both options are enabled by using [Rover] to produce (`rover supergraph compose`) or fetch (`rover supergraph fetch`) the supergraph to a file.  This file is passed to the Apollo Router using the `--supergraph` flag.
  
  See the Rover documentation on [supergraphs] for more information!
  
  [Rover]: https://www.apollographql.com/rover/
  [supergraphs]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/supergraphs/

- **Query planning and execution**

  The Apollo Router supports Federation 2 query planning using the same implementation we use in Apollo Gateway for maximum compatibility.  In the future, we would like to migrate the query planner to Rust.  Query plans are cached in the Apollo Router for improved performance.
  
- **Performance**

  We've created benchmarks demonstrating the performance advantages of a Rust-based Apollo Router. Early results show a substantial performance improvement over our Node.js based Apollo Gateway, with the possibility of improving performance further for future releases. 
  
  Additionally, we are making benchmarking an integrated part of our CI/CD pipeline to allow us to monitor the changes over time.  We hope to bring awareness of this into the public purview as we have new learnings.
  
  See our [blog post] for more.
  
  [blog post]: https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/backend/apollo-router-our-graphql-federation-runtime-in-rust/
  
- **Apollo Sandbox Explorer**

  [Apollo Sandbox Explorer] is a powerful web-based IDE for creating, running, and managing GraphQL operations.  Visiting your Apollo Router endpoint will take you into the Apollo Sandbox Explorer, preconfigured to operate against your graph. 
  
  [Apollo Sandbox Explorer]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/

- **Introspection support**

  Introspection support makes it possible to immediately explore the graph that's running on your Apollo Router using the Apollo Sandbox Explorer.  Introspection is currently enabled by default on the Apollo Router.  In the future, we'll support toggling this behavior.
  
- **OpenTelemetry tracing**

  For enabling observability with existing infrastructure and monitoring performance, we've added support using [OpenTelemetry] tracing. A number of configuration options can be seen in the [configuration][configuration 1] documentation under the `opentelemetry` property which allows enabling Jaeger or [OTLP]. 
  
  In the event that you'd like to send data to other tracing platforms, the [OpenTelemetry Collector] can be run an agent and can funnel tracing (and eventually, metrics) to a number of destinations which are implemented as [exporters].
  
  [configuration 1]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#configuration-file
  [OpenTelemetry]: https://opentelemetry.io/
  [OTLP]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md
  [OpenTelemetry Collector]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector
  [exporters]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter
  
- **CORS customizations**

  For a seamless getting started story, the Apollo Router has CORS support enabled by default with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` set to `*`, allowing access to it from any browser environment.
  
  This configuration can be adjusted using the [CORS configuration] in the documentation.
  
  [CORS configuration]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#handling-cors

- **Subgraph routing URL overrides**

  Routing URLs are encoded in the supergraph, so specifying them explicitly isn't always necessary.
  
  In the event that you have dynamic subgraph URLs, or just want to quickly test something out locally, you can override subgraph URLs in the configuration.
  
  Changes to the configuration will be hot-reloaded by the running Apollo Router.
  
## 📚 Documentation

  The beginnings of the [Apollo Router's documentation] is now available in the Apollo documentation. We look forward to continually improving it!

- **Quickstart tutorial**

  The [quickstart tutorial] offers a quick way to try out the Apollo Router using a pre-deployed set of subgraphs we have running in the cloud.  No need to spin up local subgraphs!  You can of course run the Apollo Router with your own subgraphs too by providing a supergraph.
  
- **Configuration options**

  On our [configuration][configuration 2] page we have a set of descriptions for some common configuration options (e.g., supergraph and CORS) as well as a [full configuration] file example of the currently supported options.

# [v0.1.0-prealpha.5] 2021-11-09

## :rocket: Features

- **An updated `CHANGELOG.md`!**

  As we build out the base functionality for the router, we haven't spent much time updating the `CHANGELOG`. We should probably get better at that!

  This release is the last one before reveal! 🎉

## :bug: Fixes

- **Potentially, many!**

  But the lack of clarity goes back to not having kept track of everything thus far! We can _fix_ our processes to keep track of these things! :smile_cat:

# [0.1.0] - TBA
