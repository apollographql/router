import RouterServices from '../../../../../shared/router-lifecycle-services.mdx';

A _selector_ is used to extract data from the GraphOS Router's request lifecycle (pipeline) services and attach them to telemetry, specifically [spans](/router/configuration/telemetry/instrumentation/spans), [instruments](/router/configuration/telemetry/instrumentation/instruments), [conditions](/router/configuration/telemetry/instrumentation/conditions) and [events](/router/configuration/telemetry/instrumentation/events).

An example of a selector, `request_header`, of the router service on a custom span attribute:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      mode: spec_compliant
      router:
        attributes:
          "my_attribute":
            # ...
            request_header: "x-my-header" #highlight-line
```

## Selector configuration reference

Each service of the router pipeline (`router`, `supergraph`, `subgraph`) has its own available selectors.
You can also extract GraphQL metrics from the response data the router returns to clients.

### Router

The router service is the initial entrypoint for all requests. It is HTTP centric and deals with opaque bytes.

## Example selector configurations

Some example configurations of common use cases for selectors:

### Configuring trace ID

Logging the trace ID of a request that has GraphQL errors:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router:
        my.event:
          message: 'An event occurred'
          level: error
          on: response
          condition:
            eq:
              - on_graphql_error: true
              - true
          attributes:
            # The trace ID from the request
            id_from_header:
              trace_id: open_telemetry
```

### Setting JSON paths

Configuring selectors with JSON paths, such as supergraph `response_data` and `response_errors`:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    metrics:
      prometheus:
        enabled: true
  instrumentation:
    instruments:
      supergraph:
        my.request.on_graphql_error:
          value: event_unit
          type: counter
          unit: error
          description: my description
          condition:
            exists:
              response_errors: "$.[0].extensions.code"
          attributes:
            response_errors:
              response_errors: "$.[0].extensions.code"
```

### Getting GraphQL operation info

Configuring the `query` selector to get information about GraphQL operations, with an example for a custom view of operation limits:

```yaml
telemetry:
  exporters:
    metrics:
      common:
        views:
          # Define a custom view because operation limits are different than the default latency-oriented view of OpenTelemetry
          - name: oplimits.*
            aggregation:
              histogram:
                buckets:
                  - 0
                  - 5
                  - 10
                  - 25
                  - 50
                  - 100
                  - 500
                  - 1000
  instrumentation:
    instruments:
      supergraph:
        oplimits.aliases:
          value:
            query: aliases
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Aliases for an operation"
        oplimits.depth:
          value:
            query: depth
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Depth for an operation"
        oplimits.height:
          value:
            query: height
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Height for an operation"
        oplimits.root_fields:
          value:
            query: root_fields
          type: histogram
          unit: number
          description: "Root fields for an operation"
```
