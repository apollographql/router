import { Link } from "gatsby";

The Apollo Router supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), with exporters for:

* [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)
* [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/)
* [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
* [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md) over HTTP or gRPC

The Apollo Router generates spans that include the various phases of serving a request and associated dependencies. This is useful for showing how response time is affected by:

* Sub-request response times
* Query shape (sub-request dependencies)
* Apollo Router post-processing

Span data is sent to a collector such as [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), which can assemble spans into a gantt chart for analysis.

> To get the most out of distributed tracing, _all_ components in your system should be instrumented.

## Common configuration

### Trace config

In your router's YAML config file, the `trace_config` section contains common configuration that's used by all exporters. This section is optional, and it falls back on the values of environment variables specified by the [OpenTelemetry spec](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/sdk-environment-variables.md) if `service_name` is not set.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    trace_config:
      service_name: "router"
      service_namespace: "apollo"
      # Optional. Either a float between 0 and 1 or 'always_on' or 'always_off'
      sampler: 0.1

      # Optional. Use a parent based sampler. This enables remote spans help make a decision on if a span is sampeld or not.
      # https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/sdk.md#parentbased
      parent_based_sampler: false

      # Optional limits
      max_attributes_per_event: 10
      max_attributes_per_link: 10
      max_attributes_per_span: 10
      max_events_per_span: 10
      max_links_per_span: 10

      # Attributes particular to an exporter that have not
      # been explicitly handled in Router configuration.
      attributes:
        some.config.attribute: "config value"
```

If `service_name` is set, then environment variables are not used. However, you can embed environment variables into your router config using Unix `${key:default}` syntax.

If no environment variable is set and `service_name` is not present then `router` is used as the default service name.

### Propagation

The `propagation` section allows you to configure which propagators are active in addition to those automatically activated by using an exporter.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    propagation:
      # https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/
      baggage: false

      # https://www.datadoghq.com/
      datadog: false

      # https://www.jaegertracing.io/ (compliant with opentracing)
      jaeger: false

      # https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/
      trace_context: false

      # https://zipkin.io/ (compliant with opentracing)
      zipkin: false

      # If you have your own way to generate a trace id and you want to pass it via a custom request header
      request:
        header_name: my-trace-id
```

Specifying explicit propagation is generally only required if you're using an exporter that supports multiple trace ID formats (e.g., OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, or OpenTracing compatible exporters).

## Trace ID

> This is part of an experimental feature, it means any time until it's stabilized (without the prefix `experimental_`) we might change the configuration shape or adding/removing features.
> If you want to give feedback or participate in that feature feel free to join [this discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/2147).

If you want to expose in response headers the generated trace ID or the one you provided using propagation headers you can use this configuration:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    experimental_response_trace_id:
      enabled: true # default: false
      header_name: "my-trace-id" # default: "apollo-trace-id"
```

Using this configuration you will have a response header called `my-trace-id` containing the trace ID. It could help you to debug a specific query if you want to grep your log with this trace id to have more context.

## Batch Processor

All trace exporters (apollo|datadog|zipkin|jaeger|otlp) have batch span processor configuration, it will be necessary to tune this if you see the following in your logs:

`OpenTelemetry trace error occurred: cannot send span to the batch span processor because the channel is full`

* **scheduled_delay** The delay from receiving the first span to the batch being sent. 
* **max_concurrent_exports** The maximum number of overlapping export requests. For instance if ingest is taking a long time to respond there may be several overlapping export requests. 
* **max_export_batch_size** The number of spans to include in a batch. Your ingest may have max message size limits.
* **max_export_timeout** The timeout for sending spans before dropping the data.
* **max_queue_size** The maximum number of spans to be buffered before dropping span data.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  # Apollo tracing
  apollo:
    batch_processor:
      scheduled_delay: 100ms
      max_concurrent_exports: 1000
      max_export_batch_size: 10000
      max_export_timeout: 100s
      max_queue_size: 10000
      
  tracing:
    # Datadog
    datadog:
      batch_processor:
        scheduled_delay: 100ms
        max_concurrent_exports: 1000
        max_export_batch_size: 10000
        max_export_timeout: 100s
        max_queue_size: 10000
      endpoint: default
    # Jaeger
    # Otlp
    # Zipkin
```

You will need to experiment to find the setting that are appropriate for your use case.

## Using Datadog

The Apollo Router can be configured to connect to either the default agent address or a URL.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    datadog:
      # Either 'default' or a URL
      endpoint: default
```

## Using Jaeger

The Apollo Router can be configured to export tracing data to Jaeger either via an agent or http collector.

### Agent config

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    jaeger:
      agent:
        # Either 'default' or a URL
        endpoint: docker_jaeger:14268
```

### Collector config

If you're using Kubernetes, you can inject your secrets into configuration via environment variables:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    jaeger:
      collector:
        endpoint: "http://my-jaeger-collector"
        username: "${env.JAEGER_USERNAME}"
        password: "${env.JAEGER_PASSWORD}"
```

## OpenTelemetry Collector via OTLP

[OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) is a horizontally scalable collector that you can use to receive, process, and export your telemetry data in a pluggable way.

If you find that the built-in telemetry features of the Apollo Router are missing some desired functionality (e.g., [exporting to Kafka](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#exporters)), then it's worth considering this option.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    otlp:
      # Either 'default' or a URL
      endpoint: default

      # Optional protocol (Defaults to grpc)
      protocol: grpc

      # Optional Grpc configuration
      grpc:
        domain_name: "my.domain"
        key: ""
        ca: ""
        cert: ""
        metadata:
          foo: bar

      # Optional Http configuration
      http:
        headers:
          foo: bar

      # Optional timeout in humantime form
      timeout: 2s
```

Remember that `file.` and `env.` prefixes can be used for expansion in config yaml. e.g. `${file.ca.txt}`.

## Using Zipkin

The Apollo Router can be configured to export tracing data to either the default collector address or a URL:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  tracing:
    zipkin:
      # Either 'default' or a URL
      endpoint: http://my_zipkin_collector.dev
```
