## 🚀 Features

### Add support for single instance Redis ([Issue #2300](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2300))

For `experimental_cache` with redis caching it now works with only a single Redis instance if you provide only one URL.

### Specify content type to `application/json` when it throws an invalid GraphQL request error ([Issue #2320](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/2320))

### Move APQ and EnsureQueryPresence in the router service ([PR #2296](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/2296))

Moving APQ from the axum level to the supergraph service reintroduced a `Buffer` in the service pipeline.
Now the APQ and`EnsureQueryPresence ` layers are part of the router service, to remove that `Buffer`.
