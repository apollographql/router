title: Creating a custom Apollo Router binary
---

import ElasticNotice from '../../shared/elastic-notice.mdx';

To use [custom plugins](./native/) that aren't bundled with the default Apollo Router distribution, you need to compile your own custom router binary. This page walks you through creating that binary from scratch and adding a plugin to it.

<ElasticNotice />

## Prerequisites

To compile the Apollo Router, you need to have the following installed:

<!-- renovate-automation: rustc version -->
* [Rust 1.67.0 or later](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [Node.js 16.9.1 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

After you install the above, also install the `cargo-xtask` and `cargo-scaffold` crates:

```sh
cargo install cargo-xtask
cargo install cargo-scaffold
```

## 1. Create a new project

1. Use the `cargo-scaffold` command to create a project for your custom router:

   ```bash
   cargo-scaffold scaffold https://github.com/apollographql/router.git -r apollo-router-scaffold/templates/base -t main
   ```

2. The `cargo-scaffold` command prompts you for some configuration settings. For the purposes of this tutorial, set your project's name to `starstuff`.

3. After your project is created, change to the `starstuff` directory:

   ```bash
   cd starstuff
   ```

The generated project has the following layout:

```bash
starstuff
├── Cargo.toml       # Dependencies are declared here
├── README.md
├── router.yaml      # Router yaml config
├── src
│   ├── main.rs      # Entry point
│   └── plugins      # Custom plugins are located here
│       └── mod.rs
└── xtask            # Build support files
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── main.rs
```

The Apollo Router uses an auto-discovery mechanism for plugins, so any plugins you add via dependency are automatically available to the Router at runtime.

## 2. Compile the router

Create a debug build of the Apollo Router with the following command:

```bash
cargo build
```

The resulting debug binary is located in `target/debug/router`.

To create a release build for production environments, use this command instead:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The resulting release binary is now located in `target/release/router`.

## 3. Run the compiled binary

Now you can test out your compiled router with an example supergraph schema.

1. Download the example schema with the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://supergraph.demo.starstuff.dev/ > supergraph-schema.graphql
   ```

2. Run the router and provide the example schema like so:

   ```bash
   cargo run -- --hot-reload --config router.yaml --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
   ```

   During development, it's helpful to use `cargo run` to run the router.

> If you're using managed federation, you set the `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variables instead of specifying the supergraph schema as a file. For details, see [this section](../managed-federation/setup#4-connect-the-router-to-studio).

## 4. Create a plugin

1. From within your project directory, scaffold a new plugin with the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo router plugin create hello_world
   ```

2. The command prompts you to choose a starting template:

   ```bash {2}
   Select a plugin template:
   > "basic"
   "auth"
   "tracing"
   ```

   The available templates are:

   * `basic` - a barebones plugin
   * `auth` - an authentication plugin for making an external call
   * `tracing` - a telemetry plugin that adds a custom metric span and a log message

   For the purposes of this tutorial, choose `basic`.

4. Add configuration options for the created plugin to your `router.yaml` file:

   ```yaml  title="router.yaml"
   plugins:
     starstuff.hello_world:
       message: "starting my plugin"
   ```

5. Run the router again:

    ```bash
    cargo run -- --hot-reload --config router.yaml --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
    ```

    This time, you should see a log line like the following:

    ```bash
    2022-05-21T09:16:33.160288Z  INFO router::plugins::hello_world: starting my plugin
    ```

Nice work! You now have a custom router binary with an associated plugin. Next, you can extend the plugin with the functionality you need or add more plugins.

## Removing a plugin

To remove a previously added plugin from your router project, use the following command:

```bash
cargo router plugin remove hello_world
```

Note that depending on the structure of your plugin, the command might fail to remove all of its associated files.

## Docker

You can use the provided [Dockerfile](https://github.com/apollographql/router/tree/main/apollo-router-scaffold/templates/base/Dockerfile) to build a release container.

Make sure your router is configured to listen to `0.0.0.0` so you can query it from outside the container:

```yml
 supergraph:
   listen: 0.0.0.0:4000
```

Use your `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variables to run the router in managed federation.

   ```bash
      docker build -t my_custom_router .
      docker run -e APOLLO_KEY="your apollo key" -e APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="your apollo graph ref" my_custom_router
   ```

Otherwise add a `COPY` step to the Dockerfile, and edit the entrypoint:

```Dockerfile
# Copy configuration for docker image
COPY router.yaml /dist/config.yaml
# Copy supergraph for docker image
COPY my_supergraph.graphql /dist/supergraph.graphql

# [...] and change the entrypoint

# Default executable is the router
ENTRYPOINT ["/dist/router", "-s", "/dist/supergraph.graphql"]
```
