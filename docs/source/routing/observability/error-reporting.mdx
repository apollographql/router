You can configure your managed gateway to send error reports to Apollo via _out-of-band reporting_. These reports help Apollo improve the performance and reliability of managed federation.

## Enabling reporting

To enable out-of-band error reporting, set the following environment variable in your gateway's environment:

```bash
APOLLO_OUT_OF_BAND_REPORTER_ENDPOINT=https://outofbandreporter.api.apollographql.com
```

The next time you start up your gateway, out-of-band error reporting is enabled.

<Note>

If you've enabled out-of-band reporting in the past, you might have specified a URL that is now deprecated. Double-check your configuration to make sure you've specified the URL listed above.

</Note>

## How it works

Whenever your gateway fails to fetch its supergraph schema from Apollo due to an error, the out-of-band reporting mechanism sends an error report to Apollo as a GraphQL mutation.

The report provides the following information as GraphQL variables:

* The error code and message produced by the gateway
* The HTTP Request URL and body
* The HTTP Response status code and body
* The `started-at` and `end-at` times of the request

It also provides the following HTTP headers:

* `apollographql-client-name`: The name of the GraphQL client used by the Gateway
* `apollographql-client-version`: The version number of the GraphQL client used by the Gateway
