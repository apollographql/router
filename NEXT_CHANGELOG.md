# [0.10.1] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd
## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### Relax plugin api mutability ([PR #1340](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1340) ([PR #1289](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1289)

the `Plugin::*_service()` methods were taking a `&mut self` as argument, but since
they work like a tower Layer, they can use `&self` instead. This change
then allows us to move from Buffer to service factories for the query
planner, execution and subgraph services

## üöÄ Features

### Add support to add custom resources on metrics. [PR #1354](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1354)

Resources are almost like attributes but there are more globals. They are directly configured on the metrics exporter which means you'll always have these resources on each of your metrics. It could be pretty useful to set
a service name for example to let you more easily find metrics related to a specific service.

```yaml
telemetry:
  metrics:
    common:
      resources:
        # Set the service name to easily find metrics related to the apollo-router in your metrics dashboards
        service.name: "apollo-router"
```

## üêõ Fixes

### Fix fragment on interface without typename [PR #1371](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1371)

When the subgraph doesn't return the typename and the type condition of a fragment is an interface, we should return the values if the entity implements the interface

### Fix detection of an introspection query [PR #1370](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1370)

A query with at the root only one selection field equals to `__typename` must be considered as an introspection query

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1370

### Accept nullable list as input [PR #1363](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1363)

Do not throw a validation error when you give `null` for an input variable of type `[Int!]`.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Replace Buffers of tower services with service factories ([PR #1289](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1289) [PR #1355](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1355))

tower services should be used by creating a new service instance for each new session
instead of going through a Buffer.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1289  https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1355

### Render embedded Sandbox instead of landing page ([PR #1369](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1369))

Open the router URL in a browser and start querying the router from the Apollo Sandbox.
