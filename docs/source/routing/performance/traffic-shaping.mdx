description: Fine-tune traffic performance and reliability in GraphOS Router and Apollo Router Core with YAML configuration for client and subgraph traffic shaping. 
---

The GraphOS Router and Apollo Router Core provide various features to improve the performance and reliability of the traffic between the client and router and between the router and subgraphs.

## Configuration

By default, the `traffic_shaping` plugin is enabled with [preset values](#preset-values). To override presets, add `traffic_shaping` to your [YAML config file](/router/configuration/overview/#yaml-config-file) like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
traffic_shaping:
  router: # Rules applied to requests from clients to the router
    global_rate_limit: # Accept a maximum of 10 requests per 5 secs. Excess requests must be rejected.
      capacity: 10
      interval: 5s # Must not be greater than 18_446_744_073_709_551_615 milliseconds and not less than 0 milliseconds
    timeout: 50s # If a request to the router takes more than 50secs then cancel the request (30 sec by default)
    concurrency_limit: 100 # The router is limited to processing 100 concurrent requests. Excess requests must be rejected.
  all:
    deduplicate_query: true # Enable query deduplication for all subgraphs.
    compression: br # Enable brotli compression for all subgraphs.
  subgraphs: # Rules applied to requests from the router to individual subgraphs
    products:
      deduplicate_query: false # Disable query deduplication for the products subgraph.
      compression: gzip # Enable gzip compression only for the products subgraph.
      global_rate_limit: # Accept a maximum of 10 requests per 5 secs from the router. Excess requests must be rejected.
        capacity: 10
        interval: 5s # Must not be greater than 18_446_744_073_709_551_615 milliseconds and not less than 0 milliseconds
      timeout: 50s # If a request to the subgraph 'products' takes more than 50secs then cancel the request (30 sec by default)
      experimental_http2: enable # Configures HTTP/2 usage. Can be 'enable' (default), 'disable' or 'http2only'
```

### Preset values

The preset values of `traffic_shaping` that's enabled by default:

- `timeout: 30s` for all timeouts
- `experimental_http2: enable`

## Client side traffic shaping

### Rate limiting

The router can apply rate limiting on client requests, as follows:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
traffic_shaping:
  router: # Rules applied to requests from clients to the router
    global_rate_limit: # Accept a maximum of 10 requests per 5 secs. Excess requests must be rejected.
      capacity: 10
      interval: 5s # Must not be greater than 18_446_744_073_709_551_615 milliseconds and not less than 0 milliseconds
```

This rate limiting applies to all requests, there is no filtering per IP or other criteria.

### Timeouts

The router applies a default timeout of 30 seconds for all requests, including the following:

- Requests the client makes to the router
- Requests the router makes to subgraphs
- Initial requests subgraphs make to the router for [subscription callbacks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#http)
  - For subscriptions callbacks, the timeout only applies to the initial request to the router. Once the subscription has been established, the request duration can exceed the timeout.

You can change the default timeout for client requests to the router like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
traffic_shaping:
  router:
    timeout: 50s # If client requests to the router take more than 50 seconds, cancel the request (30 seconds by default)
```

You can change the default timeout for all requests between the router and subgraphs like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
traffic_shaping:
  all:
    timeout: 50s # If subgraph requests take more than 50 seconds, cancel the request (30 seconds by default)
```

<Note>

Since [deferred](/router/executing-operations/defer-support/#what-is-defer) fragments are separate requests, each fragment's request is individually subject to timeouts.

</Note>

### Concurrency

By default, the router does not enforce a concurrency limit. To enforce a limit, change your config to include:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
traffic_shaping:
  router:
    concurrency_limit: 100 # The router is limited to processing 100 concurrent requests. Excess requests must be rejected.
```

<Note>

This is not a concurrency limit on connections, but a limit on the number of active requests being processed by the router at any one time.

</Note>

### Compression

Compression is automatically supported on the client side, depending on the `Accept-Encoding` header provided by the client.

### Query batching

The router has support for receiving client query batches:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
batching:
  enabled: true
  mode: batch_http_link
```

For details, see [query batching for the router](/router/executing-operations/query-batching).

## Subgraph traffic shaping

The router supports various options affecting traffic destined for subgraphs, that can either be defined for all subgraphs, or overriden per subgraph:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
traffic_shaping:
  all:
    deduplicate_query: true # Enable query deduplication for all subgraphs.
  subgraphs: # Rules applied to requests from the router to individual subgraphs
    products:
      deduplicate_query: false # Disable query deduplication for the products subgraph.
```

### Compression

The router can compress request bodies to subgraphs (along with response bodies to clients).
It currently supports these algorithms: `gzip`, `br`, and `deflate`.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
traffic_shaping:
  all:
    compression: gzip # Enable gzip compression for all subgraphs.
```

Subgraph response decompression is always supported for these algorithms: `gzip`, `br`, and `deflate`.

<Note>

Brotli (`br`) compression is not supported by Apollo Server, due to its underlying Express.js not supporting it out of the box. Therefore, don't configure `br` compression for traffic shaping when using Apollo Server as a subgraph server with the router. 

</Note>

### Rate limiting

Subgraph request rate limiting uses the same configuration as client rate limiting, and is calculated per subgraph, not per backend host.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
traffic_shaping:
  all:
    global_rate_limit: # Accept a maximum of 10 requests per 5 secs. Excess requests must be rejected.
      capacity: 10
      interval: 5s # Must not be greater than 18_446_744_073_709_551_615 milliseconds and not less than 0 milliseconds
```

### Variable deduplication

When subgraphs are sent entity requests by the router using the `_entities` field, it is often the case that the same entity (identified by a unique `@key` constraint) is requested multiple times within the execution of a single federated query.  For example, an author's name might need to be fetched multiple times when accessing a list of a reviews for a product for which the author has written multiple reviews.

To reduce the size of subgraph requests and the amount of work they might perform, the list of entities sent can be deduplicated. This is always active.

### Query deduplication

If the router is simultaneously processing similar queries, it may result in producing multiple identical requests to a subgraph.  With the `deduplicate_query` functionality enabled (by default, it is disabled), the router can avoid sending the same query multiple times and instead buffer one or more of the dependent queries pending the result of the first, and reuse that result to fulfill all of the initial queries.  This will reduce the overall traffic to the subgraph and the overall client request latency.  To meet the criteria for deduplication, the feature must be enabled and the subgraph queries must have have the same HTTP path, headers and body:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
traffic_shaping:
  all:
    deduplicate_query: true # Enable query deduplication for all subgraphs.
```

### HTTP/2

<HttpConnection type="subgraph" />

### Ordering

Traffic shaping always executes these steps in the same order, to ensure a consistent behavior. Declaration order in the configuration will not affect the runtime order:

- preparing the subgraph request
- variable deduplication
- query deduplication
- timeout
- rate limiting
- compression
- sending the request to the subgraph
