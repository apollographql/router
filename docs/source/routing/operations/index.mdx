Responsive applications rely on the router to handle operations in real time. You can configure to support various real-time operations:

- [**Subscriptions**](/graphos/routing/operations/subscriptions) - support GraphQL subscription operations
- [**Defer**](/graphos/routing/operations/defer) - use the `@defer` directive to enable incremental delivery of response data
- [**File Uploads**](/graphos/routing/operations/file-upload) - upload files to the router using multipart HTTP requests
