## Standard metric instruments

GraphOS Router and Apollo Router Core provide a set of standard router instruments that expose detailed information about the router's request lifecycle. You can consume the metrics they capture by configuring a [metrics exporter](/router/configuration/telemetry/exporters/metrics/overview).

Standard router instruments are different than OpenTelemetry (OTel) instruments or custom instruments:

- Router instruments provide standard metrics about the router request lifeycle and have names starting with `apollo.router` or `apollo_router`.
- OTel instruments provide metrics about the HTTP lifecycle and have names starting with `http`.
- Custom instruments provide customized metrics about the router request lifecycle.

The rest of this reference lists the available standard router instruments.

### Measuring router overhead

Measuring overhead in the router can be challenging because it consists of multiple components, each executing tasks in parallel. Subgraph latency, cache performance, and plugins influence performance and have the potential to cause back pressure. Limitations to CPU, memory, and network bandwidth can all create bottlenecks that hinder request processing. External factors such as request rate and operation complexity heavily affect the router’s overall load.

You can find the activity of a particular request in its trace spans. Spans have the following attributes:
  - <code>busy_ns</code> - time in which the span is actively executing
  - <code>idle_ns</code> - time in which the span is alive, but not actively executing

These attributes represent how a span spends time (in nanoseconds) over its lifetime. Your APM provider can likely use this trace data to generate synthetic metrics which you can then create an approximation of.

### GraphQL

- `apollo.router.graphql_error` - counts GraphQL errors in responses. Also counts errors which occur during the response validation phase, which are represented in client responses as `extensions.valueCompletion` instead of actual GraphQL errors. Attributes:
  - `code`: error code, including `RESPONSE_VALIDATION_FAILED` in the case of a value completion error.

### Session

- `apollo.router.session.count.active` - Number of in-flight GraphQL requests

### Cache

- `apollo.router.cache.size` — Number of entries in the cache
- `apollo.router.cache.hit.time` - Time to hit the cache in seconds
- `apollo.router.cache.hit.time.count` - Number of cache hits
- `apollo.router.cache.miss.time` - Time to miss the cache in seconds
- `apollo.router.cache.miss.time.count` - Number of cache misses
- `apollo.router.cache.storage.estimated_size` - The estimated storage size of the cache in bytes (query planner in memory only).

All cache metrics listed above have the following attributes:

- `kind`: the cache being queried (`apq`, `query planner`, `introspection`)
- `storage`: The backend storage of the cache (`memory`, `redis`)

### Redis Cache

When using Redis as a cache backend, additional Redis-specific metrics are available:

- `apollo.router.cache.redis.connections` - Number of Redis connections established
- `apollo.router.cache.redis.command_queue_length` - Number of Redis commands buffered and not yet sent  
- `apollo.router.cache.redis.commands_executed` - Total number of Redis commands executed
- `apollo.router.cache.redis.redelivery_count` - Number of Redis command redeliveries due to connection issues
- `apollo.router.cache.redis.errors` - Number of Redis errors by error type and cache kind
- `experimental.apollo.router.cache.redis.latency_avg` - Average Redis command latency in seconds
- `experimental.apollo.router.cache.redis.network_latency_avg` - Average Redis network latency in seconds  
- `experimental.apollo.router.cache.redis.request_size_avg` - Average Redis request size in bytes
- `experimental.apollo.router.cache.redis.response_size_avg` - Average Redis response size in bytes

All Redis metrics include the following attribute:

- `kind`: the cache being queried (`apq`, `query planner`, `introspection`, `entity`)

The `apollo.router.cache.redis.errors` metric also includes an `error_type` attribute with possible values:
- `config` - Configuration errors (invalid Redis settings)
- `auth` - Authentication errors (wrong credentials)
- `routing` - Cluster routing errors
- `io` - Network I/O errors
- `invalid_command` - Invalid Redis commands
- `invalid_argument` - Invalid command arguments
