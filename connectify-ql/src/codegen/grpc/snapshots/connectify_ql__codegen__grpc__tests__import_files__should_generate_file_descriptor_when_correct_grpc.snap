Leap seconds are \"smeared\" so that no leap\n second table is needed for interpretation, using a [24-hour linear\n smear](https://developers.google.com/time/smear).\n\n The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By\n restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from [RFC\n 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) date strings.\n\n # Examples\n\n Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `time()`.\n\n     Timestamp timestamp;\n     timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL));\n     timestamp.set_nanos(0);\n\n Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `gettimeofday()`.\n\n     struct timeval tv;\n     gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);\n\n     Timestamp timestamp;\n     timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec);\n     timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);\n\n Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`.\n\n     FILETIME ft;\n     GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft);\n     UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;\n\n     // A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds. Windows epoch 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z\n     // is 11644473600 seconds before Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.\n     Timestamp timestamp;\n     timestamp.set_seconds((INT64) ((ticks / 10000000) - 11644473600LL));\n     timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));\n\n Example 4: Compute Timestamp from Java `System.currentTimeMillis()`.\n\n     long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n\n     Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000)\n         .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();\n\n\n Example 5: Compute Timestamp from Java `Instant.now()`.\n\n     Instant now = Instant.now();\n\n     Timestamp timestamp =\n         Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(now.getEpochSecond())\n             .setNanos(now.getNano()).build();\n\n\n Example 6: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.\n\n     timestamp = Timestamp()\n     timestamp.GetCurrentTime()\n\n # JSON Mapping\n\n In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the\n [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the\n format is \"{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z\"\n where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day},\n {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional\n seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution),\n are optional. The \"Z\" suffix indicates the timezone (\"UTC\"); the timezone\n is required. A proto3 JSON serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by\n \"Z\") when printing the Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be\n able to accept both UTC and other timezones (as indicated by an offset).\n\n For example, \"2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z\" encodes 15.01 seconds past\n 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.\n\n In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the\n standard\n [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString)\n method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted\n to this format using\n [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with\n the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use\n the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`](\n http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime%2D%2D\n ) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.\n\n\n",
