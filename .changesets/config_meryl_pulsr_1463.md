### Make experimental OTLP error metrics feature flag non-experimental ([PR #7033](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/7033))

Because the OTLP error metrics feature is being promoted to `preview` from `experimental`, this change updates its feature flag name from `experimental_otlp_error_metrics` to `preview_extended_error_metrics`.
