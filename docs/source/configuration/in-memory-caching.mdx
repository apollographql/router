title: In-memory caching in the Apollo Router
---

The Apollo Router uses an in-memory LRU cache to store the following data:

- [Generated query plans](#caching-query-plans)
- [Automatic persisted queries (APQ)](#caching-automatic-persisted-queries-apq)
- Introspection responses

You can configure certain caching behaviors for generated query plans and APQ (but not introspection responses).

> **If you have a GraphOS Enterprise plan,** you can also configure a Redis-backed _distributed_ cache that enables multiple router instances to share cached values. For details, see [Distributed caching in the Apollo Router](./distributed-caching/)

## Caching query plans

Whenever your router receives an incoming GraphQL operation, it generates a **query plan** to determine which subgraphs it needs to query to resolve that operation.

>[Learn more about query plans.](/federation/query-plans/)

By caching previously generated query plans, your router can _skip_ generating them _again_ if a client later sends the exact same operation. This improves your router's responsiveness.

The Apollo Router enables query plan caching by default. In your router's [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file), you can configure the maximum number of query plan entries in the cache like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
  query_planning:
    experimental_cache:
      in_memory:
        limit: 512 # This is the default value.
```

On schema reloads, the cache will be reset, and queries will need to go through query planning again. To avoid latencies right after the reload, you can configure the router to pregenerate query plans for the most used queries before switching to the new schema:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
supergraph:
  query_planning:
    # Pre-plan the 100 most used operations when the supergraph changes.  (Default is "0", disabled.)
    warmed_up_queries: 100
    experimental_cache:
      in_memory:
        limit: 512
```

## Caching automatic persisted queries (APQ)

**Automatic Persisted Queries** (**APQ**) enable GraphQL clients to send a server the _hash_ of their query string, _instead of_ sending the query string itself. When query strings are very large, this can significantly reduce network usage.

> [Learn more about APQ](/apollo-server/performance/apq/).

The Apollo Router supports using APQ in its communications with both clients _and_ subgraphs:

- **In its communications with clients,** the router acts as a GraphQL _server_, because it _receives_ queries from clients.
- **In its communications with subgraphs,** the router acts as a GraphQL _client_, because it _sends_ queries to subgraphs.

Because the router's role differs between these two interactions, you configure these APQ settings separately.

### APQ with clients

The Apollo Router enables APQ caching for client operations by default. In your router's [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file), you can configure the maximum number of APQ entries in the cache like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
apq:
  router:
    cache:
      in_memory:
        limit: 512 # This is the default value.
```

You can also _disable_ client APQ support entirely like so:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
apq:
  enabled: false
```

### APQ with subgraphs

By default, the Apollo Router does _not_ use APQ when sending queries to its subgraphs.

In your router's [YAML config file](./overview/#yaml-config-file), you can configure this APQ support with a combination of global and per-subgraph settings:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
apq:
  subgraph:
    # Disables subgraph APQ globally except where overridden per-subgraph
    all:
      enabled: false
    # Override global APQ setting for individual subgraphs
    subgraphs:
      products:
        enabled: true
```

In the example above, subgraph APQ is disabled _except for_ the `products` subgraph.
