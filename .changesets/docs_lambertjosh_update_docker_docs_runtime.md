### Updates the Docker deployment instructions to use the Apollo Runtime container [PR #7734](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/7734)

With the release of the MCP Server, a method to easily deploy Apollo's runtime services was needed. The Apollo Runtime container was designed to address this need, which includes both the Router and MCP Servers in a single Docker container. This PR updates the Router deployment Docker instructions to use this new container.
