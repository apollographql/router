### Improve Uplink error and warning messages ([Issue #3877](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/3877))

A few log messages for Apollo Uplink have been improved:

- Added a warning if the router is started with only a single Uplink URL.
- Improved the error messages shown when a fetch from Uplink fails.
