# [0.14.1] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## ‚ùó BREAKING ‚ùó

### CORS: Deprecate newly-added `allow_any_header` option and return to previous behavior ([PR #1480](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1480))

We've re-considered and reverted changes we shipped in the last release with regards to how we handle the [`Access-Control-Request-Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Request-Headers) *request* header and its corresponding [`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) response header.  We've reverted to the previous releases' behavior, including the removal of the recently-added `allow_any_header` option.

The previous default behavior was to **reflect** the client's `Access-Control-Request-Headers` request header values back in the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header.  This previous behavior is in fact a common default behavior in other CORS libraries as well, including the [`cors`](https://npm.im/cors) Node.js package and we think it's worth keeping as it was previously, rather than requiring users to specify `allow_any_header` for the _majority_ of use cases.  We believe this to be a safe and secure default that is also more user-friendly.

It is not typically necessary to change this default behavior, but if you wish to allow a more specific set of headers, you can disable the default header reflection and specify a list of headers using the `allow_headers` option, which will allow only those headers in negotiating a response:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
server:
  cors:
    allow_any_origin: true
    # Including this `allow_headers` isn't typically necessary (can be removed) but
    # will *restrict* the permitted Access-Control-Allow-Headers response values.
    allow_headers:
      - Content-Type
      - Authorization
      - x-my-custom-header
```

### Reference-counting for the schema string given to plugins ([PR #???](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/))

The type of the `supergraph_sdl` field of the `apollo_router::plugin::PluginInit` struct
was changed from `String` to `Arc<String>`.
This reduces the number of copies of this string we keep in memory, as schemas can get large.

### Configuration handling enhancements ([PR #1454](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1454))

Router config handling now:
* Allows completely empty configuration without error.
* Prevents unknown tags at the root of the configuration from being silently ignored.

### CORS: Fix trailing slashes, and display defaults ([PR #1471](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1471))

The CORS documentation now displays a valid `origins` configuration (without trailing slash!), and the full configuration section displays its default settings.
