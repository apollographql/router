import { Link } from 'gatsby';

**The Apollo Router** is a configurable, high-performance **graph router** for a federated supergraph. You can use it with any [Apollo Federation](/federation/) architecture (v1 or v2):

```mermaid
flowchart BT;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph " ";
  gateway(["Apollo Router"]);
  serviceA[Users<br/>subgraph];
  serviceB[Products<br/>subgraph];
  serviceC[Reviews<br/>subgraph];
  gateway --- serviceA & serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.- gateway;
  class clients secondary;
```
 
If you have an existing supergraph that currently uses `@apollo/gateway`, you can move to the Apollo Router without changing any other part of your supergraph.

  <Button
    colorScheme="indigo"
    to="/router/quickstart/"
    as={Link}
    style={{
      marginRight: '10px'
    }}
  >
    Try it out!
  </Button>
  <Button
    colorScheme="gray"
    to="/router/migrating-from-gateway/"
    as={Link}
  >
    Migrate from @apollo/gateway
  </Button>
</p>
