# [0.14.1] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## ❗ BREAKING ❗

### Reference-counting for the schema string given to plugins ([PR #???](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/))

The type of the `supergraph_sdl` field of the `apollo_router::plugin::PluginInit` struct
was changed from `String` to `Arc<String>`.
This reduces the number of copies of this string we keep in memory, as schemas can get large.

### Remove Buffer from Mock*Service ([PR #1440](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1440)

This removes the usage of `tower_test::mock::Mock` in mocked services because it isolated the service in a task
so panics triggered by mockall were not transmitted up to the unit test that should catch it.
This rewrites the mocked services API to remove the `build()` method, and make them clonable if needed,
using an `expect_clone` call with mockall.

### Update span attributes to be compliant with the opentelemetry for GraphQL specs ([PR #1449](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1449))

### Configuration handling enhancements ([PR #1454](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1454))

Router config handling now:
* Allows completely empty configuration without error.
* Prevents unknown tags at the root of the configuration from being silently ignored.

### CORS: Fix trailing slashes, and display defaults ([PR #1471](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1471))

The CORS documentation now displays a valid `origins` configuration (without trailing slash!), and the full configuration section displays its default settings.
