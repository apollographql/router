# [0.14.1] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## ❗ BREAKING ❗

### Reference-counting for the schema string given to plugins ([PR #???](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/))

The type of the `supergraph_sdl` field of the `apollo_router::plugin::PluginInit` struct
was changed from `String` to `Arc<String>`.
This reduces the number of copies of this string we keep in memory, as schemas can get large.

## 🚀 Features

## 🐛 Fixes

### Add support of global rate limit and timeout. [PR #1347](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1347)

Additions to the traffic shaping plugin:
- **Global rate limit** - If you want to rate limit requests to subgraphs or to the router itself.
- **Timeout**: - Set a timeout to subgraphs and router requests.

```yaml
traffic_shaping:
  router: # Rules applied to requests from clients to the router
    global_rate_limit: # Accept a maximum of 10 requests per 5 secs. Excess requests must be rejected.
      capacity: 10
      interval: 5s
    timeout: 50s # If a request to the router takes more than 50secs then cancel the request (30 sec by default)
  subgraphs: # Rules applied to requests from the router to individual subgraphs
    products:
      global_rate_limit: # Accept a maximum of 10 requests per 5 secs from the router. Excess requests must be rejected.
        capacity: 10
        interval: 5s
      timeout: 50s # If a request to the subgraph 'products' takes more than 50secs then cancel the request (30 sec by default)
```

### Configuration handling enhancements ([PR #1454](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1454))

Router config handling now:
* Allows completely empty configuration without error.
* Prevents unknown tags at the root of the configuration from being silently ignored.

### CORS: Fix trailing slashes, and display defaults ([PR #1471](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1471))

The CORS documentation now displays a valid `origins` configuration (without trailing slash!), and the full configuration section displays its default settings.
