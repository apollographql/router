## :rocket::waxing_crescent_moon: Public alpha release

> An alpha or beta release is in volatile, active development. The release might not be feature-complete, and breaking API changes are possible between individual versions.

## :sparkles: Features

- Trace sampling [#228](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/228): Tracing each request can be expensive. The router now supports sampling, which allows us to only send a fraction of the received requests.

- Health check [#54](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/54)

## :bug: Fixes

- Schema parse errors [#136](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/136): The router wouldn't display what went wrong when parsing an invalid Schema. It now displays exactly where a the parsing error occured, and why.

- Various tracing and telemetry fixes [#237](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/237): The router wouldn't display what went wrong when parsing an invalid Schema. It now displays exactly where a the parsing error occured, and why.

- Query variables validation [#62](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/62): Now that we have a schema parsing feature, we can validate the variables and their types against the schemas and queries.


# [v0.1.0-alpha.2] 2021-12-03

# [v0.1.0-alpha.1] 2021-11-18

## :rocket::waxing_crescent_moon: Initial public alpha release

> An alpha or beta release is in volatile, active development. The release might not be feature-complete, and breaking API changes are possible between individual versions.

See our [release stages] for more information.

## :sparkles: Features

This release focuses on documentation and bug fixes, stay tuned for the next releases!

## :bug: Fixes

- Handle commas in the @join\_\_graph directive parameters [#101](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/101)

There are several accepted syntaxes to define @join\_\_graph parameters. While we did handle whitespace separated parameters such as `@join__graph(name: "accounts" url: "http://accounts/graphql")`for example, we discarded the url in`@join__graph(name: "accounts", url: "http://accounts/graphql")` (notice the comma). This pr fixes that.

- Invert subgraph URL override logic [#135](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/135)

Subservices endpoint URLs can both be defined in `supergraph.graphql` and in the subgraphs section of the `configuration.yml` file. The configuration now correctly overrides the supergraph endpoint definition when applicable.

- Parse OTLP endpoint address [#156](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/156)

The router OpenTelemetry configuration only supported full URLs (that contain a scheme) while OpenTelemtry collectors support full URLs and endpoints, defaulting to `https`. This pull request fixes that.

## :books: Documentation

A lot of configuration examples and links have been fixed ([#117](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/117), [#120](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/120), [#133](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/133))

## :pray: Thank you!

Special thanks to @sjungling, @hsblhsn, @martin-dd, @Mithras and @vvakame for being pioneers by trying out the router, opening issues and documentation fixes! :rocket:

## :sparkles: Features

- **Federation 2 alpha**

  The Apollo Router supports the new alpha features of [Apollo Federation 2], including its improved shared ownership model and enhanced type merging.  As new Federation 2 features are released, we will update the Router to bring in that new functionality.
  
  [Apollo Federation 2]: https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/backend/announcing-federation-2/

- **Supergraph support**

  The Apollo Router supports supergraphs that are published to the Apollo Registry, or those that are composed locally.  Both options are enabled by using [Rover] to produce (`rover supergraph compose`) or fetch (`rover supergraph fetch`) the supergraph to a file.  This file is passed to the Apollo Router using the `--supergraph` flag.
  
  See the Rover documentation on [supergraphs] for more information!
  
  [Rover]: https://www.apollographql.com/rover/
  [supergraphs]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/supergraphs/

- **Query planning and execution**

  The Apollo Router supports Federation 2 query planning using the same implementation we use in Apollo Gateway for maximum compatibility.  In the future, we would like to migrate the query planner to Rust.  Query plans are cached in the Apollo Router for improved performance.
  
- **Performance**

  We've created benchmarks demonstrating the performance advantages of a Rust-based Apollo Router. Early results show a substantial performance improvement over our Node.js based Apollo Gateway, with the possibility of improving performance further for future releases. 
  
  Additionally, we are making benchmarking an integrated part of our CI/CD pipeline to allow us to monitor the changes over time.  We hope to bring awareness of this into the public purview as we have new learnings.
  
  See our [blog post] for more.

- **Apollo Sandbox Explorer**

  [Apollo Sandbox Explorer] is a powerful web-based IDE for creating, running, and managing GraphQL operations.  Visiting your Apollo Router endpoint will take you into the Apollo Sandbox Explorer, preconfigured to operate against your graph. 
  
  [Apollo Sandbox Explorer]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/

- **Introspection support**

  Introspection support makes it possible to immediately explore the graph that's running on your Apollo Router using the Apollo Sandbox Explorer.  Introspection is currently enabled by default on the Apollo Router.  In the future, we'll support toggling this behavior.
  
- **OpenTelemetry tracing**

  For enabling observability with existing infrastructure and monitoring performance, we've added support using [OpenTelemetry] tracing. A number of configuration options can be seen in the [configuration][configuration 1] documentation under the `opentelemetry` property which allows enabling Jaeger or [OTLP]. 
  
  In the event that you'd like to send data to other tracing platforms, the [OpenTelemetry Collector] can be run an agent and can funnel tracing (and eventually, metrics) to a number of destinations which are implemented as [exporters].
  
  [configuration 1]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#configuration-file
  [OpenTelemetry]: https://opentelemetry.io/
  [OTLP]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md
  [OpenTelemetry Collector]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector
  [exporters]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter
  
- **CORS customizations**

  For a seamless getting started story, the Apollo Router has CORS support enabled by default with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` set to `*`, allowing access to it from any browser environment.
  
  This configuration can be adjusted using the [CORS configuration] in the documentation.
  
  [CORS configuration]: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/#handling-cors

- **Subgraph routing URL overrides**

  Routing URLs are encoded in the supergraph, so specifying them explicitly isn't always necessary.
  
  In the event that you have dynamic subgraph URLs, or just want to quickly test something out locally, you can override subgraph URLs in the configuration.
  
  Changes to the configuration will be hot-reloaded by the running Apollo Router.
  
## 📚 Documentation

  The beginnings of the [Apollo Router's documentation] is now available in the Apollo documentation. We look forward to continually improving it!

- **Quickstart tutorial**

  The [quickstart tutorial] offers a quick way to try out the Apollo Router using a pre-deployed set of subgraphs we have running in the cloud.  No need to spin up local subgraphs!  You can of course run the Apollo Router with your own subgraphs too by providing a supergraph.
  
- **Configuration options**

  On our [configuration][configuration 2] page we have a set of descriptions for some common configuration options (e.g., supergraph and CORS) as well as a [full configuration] file example of the currently supported options.

# [v0.1.0-prealpha.5] 2021-11-09

## :rocket: Features

- **An updated `CHANGELOG.md`!**

  As we build out the base functionality for the router, we haven't spent much time updating the `CHANGELOG`. We should probably get better at that!

  This release is the last one before reveal! 🎉

## :bug: Fixes

- **Potentially, many!**

  But the lack of clarity goes back to not having kept track of everything thus far! We can _fix_ our processes to keep track of these things! :smile_cat:

# [0.1.0] - TBA
