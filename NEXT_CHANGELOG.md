# [v0.1.0-preview.7] - (unreleased)
## ❗ BREAKING ❗
### Plugin utilities cleanup ([PR #819](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/819))
Utilities around creating Request and Response structures have been migrated to builders.

Migration:
* `plugin_utils::RouterRequest::builder()`->`RouterRequest::fake_builder()`
* `plugin_utils::RouterResponse::builder()`->`RouterResponse::fake_builder()`

In addition, the `plugin_utils` module has been removed. Mock service functionality has been migrated to `plugin::utils::test`.
### Plugin API changes [PR #855](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/855)
Previously the Plugin trait has three lifecycle hooks: new, startup, and shutdown.

Startup and shutdown are problematic because:
* Plugin construction happens in new and startup. This means creating in new and populating in startup.
* Startup and shutdown has to be explained to the user.
* Startup and shutdown ordering is delicate.

The lifecycle now looks like this:
1. `new`
2. `activate`
3. `drop`

Users can migrate their plugins using the following:
* `Plugin#startup`->`Plugin#new`
* `Plugin#shutdown`->`Drop#drop`

In addition, the `activate` lifecycle hook is now not marked as deprecated, and users are free to use it.
