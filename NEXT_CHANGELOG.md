### update apollo-parser to 0.2.11

Fixes error creation for missing selection sets in named operation definitions.

### Fix router scaffold version ([Issue #1836](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1836))

Add `v` prefix to the cargo version when it's a crate version to match the git tag.

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1838

### Fixed extraVolumeMounts ([Issue #1824](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1824))

Fixed extraVolumeMounts not be being read into the deployment template correctly.

### Do not fill in a skeleton object when canceling a subgraph request ([Issue #1819](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1819))

in a query spanning multiple subgraphs like this:

query {
  currentUser {
    activeOrganization {
      id
      creatorUser {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
if the user subgraph returns {"currentUser": { "activeOrganization": null }}, then the request to the organization subgraph
is cancelled, and no data should be generated, but the query planner was wrongly creating an object at the target path.

This PR also improves the usage of mocked subgraphs with `TestHarness`.

### Defer: default defer condition to true ([Issue #1820](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1820))

According to the defer specification, defer conditions are mandatory and default to true.
We fixed a bug where the default value wasn't initialized properly.

### Support query plans with empty primary subselections ([Issue #1778](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1778))

When a query with `@defer` would result in an empty primary response, the router was returning
an error in interpreting the query plan. It is now using the query plan properly, and detects
more precisely queries containing `@defer`.

## üõ† Maintenance

### Add more compilation gates to delete useless warnings ([PR #1830](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1830))

Add more gates (for `console` feature) to not have warnings when using `--all-features`.

By [@bnjjj](https://github.com/bnjjj) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1830

### Deny panic, unwrap and expect in the spec module ([Issue #1844](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1844))

As we are progressing towards 1.0, we are progressively banning `unwrap()` and `expect()` from the critical parts of the codebase.

This codepath is exercised after Parsing has happened, so invariants expressed by `expect`s would always have been enforced or checked before. However we decided to tighten the router even further, by raising errors instead, which will provide users with even more stability guarantees.

The spec module now has gates that prevent its content from using code that explicitly panics.

```rust
#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used)]
#![deny(clippy::expect_used)]
#![deny(clippy::panic)]
```


By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1844

### Remove potential panics from query plan execution ([PR #1842](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1842))

Some parts of the code were using `expect()`, `unwrap()` and `panic()` to guard some assumptions
about data. They are now replaced with errors returned in the response.
