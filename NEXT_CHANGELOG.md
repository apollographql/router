# [0.15.1] (unreleased) - 2022-mm-dd

## ❗ BREAKING ❗

### Remove telemetry configuration hot reloading ([PR #1463](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/1463))

Configuration hot reloading is not very useful for telemetry, and is the
source of regular bugs that are hard to fix.

This removes the support for configuration reloading entirely. Now, the
router will reject a configuration reload with an error log if the
telemetry configuration changed.

It is now possible to create a subscriber and pass it explicitely to the telemetry plugin
when creating it. It will then be modified to integrate the telemetry plugin's layer.
