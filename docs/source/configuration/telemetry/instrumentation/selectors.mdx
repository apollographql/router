import RouterServices from '../../../../shared/router-lifecycle-services.mdx';

A **selector** is used to extract data from the Apollo Router's request lifecycle (pipeline) services and attach them to telemetry, specifically [spans](./spans)<!--, [instruments](./instruments), [events](./events), and [conditions](./conditions)-->.

Each service of the router pipeline (`router`, `supergraph`, `subgraph`) has its own available selectors.

An example of a selector, `request_header`, of the router service on a custom span attribute:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      router:
        attributes:
          "my_attribute":
            # ...
            request_header: "x-my-header" #highlight-line
```

### Selector configuration reference

Each service of the router pipeline (`router`, `supergraph`, `subgraph`) has its own available selectors.

#### Router

The router service is the initial entrypoint for all requests. It is HTTP centric and deals with opaque bytes.
