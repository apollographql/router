import RouterServices from '../../../../shared/router-lifecycle-services.mdx';
import TelemetryPerformanceNote from '../../../../shared/telemetry-performance.mdx';

An _event_ is used to signal when something of note happens in the [Apollo Router's request lifecycle](../../../customizations/overview/#the-request-lifecycle). Events are output to both logs and traces.

You can configure events for each service in `router.yaml`. Events can be standard or custom, and they can be triggered by configurable conditions.

## Event configuration

### Router request lifecycle services

<RouterServices />

The `router`, `supergraph` and `subgraph` sections are used to define custom event configuration for each service:

```yaml title="future.router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router: # highlight-line
        # ...     
      supergraph: # highlight-line
        # ...
      subgraph: # highlight-line
        # ...
```

### Standard events

Each service has a set of standard events that can be configured:

* `request` - The request has been received.
* `response` - The response has been sent.
* `error` - An error in the request lifecycle has occurred.

<Note>

The `error` level applies only to request lifecycle errors, not GraphQL errors.

</Note>

To configure these events, set the level to `trace`, `info`, `warn`, `error` or `off` (default).

For example:

```yaml title="future.router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router:
        request: off
        response: off
        error: error
        # ...
```

### Custom events

<PremiumFeature linkWithAnchor="https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#observability"/>

For each service you can also configure custom events.

```yaml title="future.router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router:
        # Custom events
        my.event: # This key will automatically be added as a 'type' attribute of the event
          # Custom event configuration
```

<Note>

</Note>

### `message`

Each custom event must have a message. This is a fixed value, and custom attributes should be used to add additional information.

```yaml title="future.router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router:
        acme.event:
          message: "my event message"
          # ...
```

### `on`

Each custom event must indicate when it should be triggered. This can be `request`, `response`, `event_response` or `error`.

```yaml title="future.router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router:
        acme.event:
          on: request # request, response, event_response, error
          # ...
```

> `event_response` is useful when you want to directly access to the json response body. It also works for subscription events and `@defer` chunks.

### `level`

Custom events have a level, `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` or `off` (if you want to disable this event). The level determines the severity of the event.

To set the level:
```yaml title="future.router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router:
        acme.event:
          level: info # trace, debug, info, warn, error, off
          # ...
```

### `condition`

Custom events can be configured to emit under specific conditions, for example if the response status code is 200.

In `router.yaml`, set a `condition` with an equality (`eq`) check:

```yaml title="future.router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router:
        acme.event:
          # ...
          condition:
            eq:
              - 200
              - response_status: Code
```

For more details, see [Conditions](./conditions).

### `attributes`

Custom events may have attributes attached to them from the router's request lifecycle. These attributes are used to filter and group spans in your APM.

Attributes may be drawn from [standard attributes](./standard-attributes) or [selectors](./selectors).
The attributes available depend on the service of the request lifecycle.

```yaml title="future.router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router:
        my.event:
          # ...
          attributes:
            # Standard attributes
            http.response.status_code: true
            # Custom attributes
            "my_attribute":
              response_header: "x-my-header"
```

## Event configuration example

For example, the router service can be configured with standard events (`request`, `response`, `error`), and a custom event (`my.event`) with a condition:

```yaml title="future.router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    events:
      router:
        # Standard events
        request: info
        response: info
        error: info
  
        # Custom events
        my.event:
          message: "my event message"
          level: info
          on: request
          attributes:
            http.response.body.size: false
          # Only log when the x-log-request header is `log` 
          condition:
            eq:
              - "log"
              - request_header: "x-log-request"
          
      supergraph:
          # Custom event configuration for supergraph service ...
      subgraph:
          # Custom event configuration for subgraph service ...
```
