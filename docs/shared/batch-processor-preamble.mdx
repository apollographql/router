All exporters have batch span processor configuration, it will be necessary to tune this if you see the following in your logs:

`OpenTelemetry trace error occurred: cannot send span to the batch span processor because the channel is full`

OR

`OpenTelemetry metrics error occurred: cannot send span to the batch span processor because the channel is full`

The exact settings that will work for you will depend on the amount of data you are sending to your APM, the frequency, and the limits of your APM. And you may have to tune these settings over time as your application changes.
