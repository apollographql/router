description: Set up the Apollo router, and run it against a cloud based example.
---

In this tutorial we will set up and run a router in three(3) steps!
We will then have a look at how to clone the router repository and build it from the sources.

If you are looking for an example where you can set up the subservices locally, have a look at the [üê≥ Docker based example](docker). If you would don't want to install docker locally, or want to edit the subraphs nodejs code, have a look at the the [Nodejs based example](nodejs).

## Three steps quickstart

### Prerequisites:

- None! We will use a tarball available [in the Github releases section](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases).

This configuration allows you to quickly start a router, connected to subgraphs exposed publicly in the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è. Note that this demo is available for testing / exploration purposes, and rate limiting is set up. If you would like to do more than have a look at the demo, you can run the subgraphs locally as explained in the the [üê≥ Docker based example](docker) and the [Nodejs based example](nodejs).

### Download the router binary:

Go to the [Apollo router releases section](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases) and download the latest tarball that matches your system. Available systems and architectures are `Linux(x86_64)`, `MacOS(x86_64)` and `Windows(x86_64)`.
If your target system and architecture aren't available, you can [build and run the Apollo router from source](build-and-run-the-apollo-router-from-source).

```sh
curl -o router.tar.gz https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/download/v0.1.0-prealpha.3/router-0.1.0-prealpha.3-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
```

### Unzip the router binary:

Use your favorite method to unzip the downloaded archive. The archive contains the router (built in `release` mode), and the hello-world configuration.

On linux:

```sh
tar -xczf router.tar.gz
```

### Run the router with the provided configuration

```sh
cd router
./router -p ./hello-world
```

The console output should look as following:

```sh
Nov 02 17:08:09.926  INFO router: Starting Apollo Router
Nov 02 17:08:10.279  INFO router: Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4000 üöÄ
```

This is it! You can now go to http://127.0.0.1:4000 to open the [Apollo studio explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/) and inspect the graph, and run your first queries using the Apollo federation router!

## Build and run the Apollo router from source

### Prerequisites

If you would like to compile the binary yourself, you will need:

- Rust: Head over to [the rustup website](https://rustup.rs/) to install rust

### Git clone

‚ö†Ô∏è This project uses submodules. Make sure your submodules are initialized and up to date!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apollographql/router.git
cd router
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Environment setup

This tutorial will only require one port on your machine:

- 4000: The Apollo federation router

If you would like to change the server's used port, change the `examples/hello-world/configuration.yaml` file's `listen` entry:

```yml
listen: 127.0.0.1:<YOUR_PORT>
```

You should be good to go!

## Building and running the Apollo federation router

In this project's root directory, you can run the following command to build and run the Apollo federation router:

```bash
ignition@ignition-apollo router % cargo run --release -- -p ./examples/hello-world

```

Go to http://127.0.0.1:4000 to open the [Apollo studio explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/) and inspect the graph, and run your first queries using the Apollo federation router!
