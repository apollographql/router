### Improved subscription plugin architecture ([PR #7690](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/7690))

Reorganized WebSocket subscription handling to improve code maintainability and architectural clarity. This internal refactoring consolidates subscription-related functionality within the subscription plugin, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

No functional changes - all existing subscription behavior remains the same.
