import RouterServices from '../../../shared/router-lifecycle-services.mdx';

The Apollo Router supports the collection and export of Logs, Metrics and traces.

These can be used to ensure that your federated graph services are running smoothly, and to help you debug issues when they arise.

## Key concepts

### Router request lifecycle services

<RouterServices />

### Logs and events
Logs are used to record that something has happened in the Router. They can be consumed by [logging exporter](./exporters/logging/overview) and also as part of spans via [tracing exporter](./exporters/tracing/overview).

Examples of log events include:
* Router lifecycle information.
* Warnings of misconfiguration.
* Errors that occurred during a request.

### Metrics and instruments

Metrics are used to monitor aggregate information about the Router such as histograms, gauges or counts. They are consumed via [metrics exporter](./exporters/metrics/overview).

An individual metric is called an *instrument*.

Examples of instruments include:
* Number of requests received.
* Histogram of request duration.
* Number of requests in flight.

A full list of instruments can be found [here](./instrumentation/standard-instruments).

### Traces

Traces are used to monitor the flow of a request through the Router. They are consumed via [tracing exporter](./exporters/tracing/overview).

A trace is composed of spans, which are used to capture duration and contextual information about the request as it flows through the Router request pipeline.

Examples of spans include:
* router - Wraps an entire request from the http perspective.
* supergraph - Wraps a request once graphql parsing has taken place.
* subgraph - Wraps a request to a subgraph.

Spans may include contextual information from the request such as the HTTP status code, or the name of the subgraph being queried.

### Attributes

Events, metrics and spans may all have attributes attached to them from the Apollo Router pipeline. These attributes are used to filter and group data in your APM.

Example attributes include:
* HTTP status code.
* GraphQL operation name.
* Subgraph name.

For spans attributes may be drawn from [standard attributes](./standard-attributes) or [selectors](./selectors).
We are actively working on adding support for custom attributes for events and metrics.
