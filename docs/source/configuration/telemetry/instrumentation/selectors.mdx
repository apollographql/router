description: Extract and select data from the Apollo Router's pipeline services to attach to telemetry.

import RouterServices from '../../../../shared/router-lifecycle-services.mdx';

A _selector_ is used to extract data from the Apollo Router's request lifecycle (pipeline) services and attach them to telemetry, specifically [spans](./spans), [instruments](./instruments), [conditions](./conditions) and [events](./events).

An example of a selector, `request_header`, of the router service on a custom span attribute:

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  instrumentation:
    spans:
      router:
        attributes:
          "my_attribute":
            # ...
            request_header: "x-my-header" #highlight-line
```

## Selector configuration reference

Each service of the router pipeline (`router`, `supergraph`, `subgraph`) has its own available selectors.
You can also extract GraphQL metrics from the response data the router returns to clients.

### Router

The router service is the initial entrypoint for all requests. It is HTTP centric and deals with opaque bytes.
