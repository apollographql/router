### Update deno, so we can generate docs again ([Issue #3305](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/3305))

Router docs failed to build on crates.io because of a documentation compile error in Deno.
This updates Deno to the latest version, which allows us to generate crates.io documentation again.
