## ❗ BREAKING ❗
## 🚀 Features
## 🐛 Fixes

### `@defer`: duplicated errors across incremental items ([Issue #1834](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1834), [Issue #1818](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/1818))

If a deferred response contains incremental responses, the errors should be dispatched in each increment according to the
error's path.
