title: Debugging Client Requests to GraphOS Router
subtitle: Options for analyzing and debugging incoming requests
description: Learn how to use GraphOS router telemetry and GraphOS Insights to inspect and debug incoming HTTP client requests.
---

By default, the GraphOS Router doesn't generate logs for incoming HTTP requests nor export other telemetry metrics. The high request volume your router likely processes can generate significant telemetry data, increasing observability costs. For this reason, you can [configure](/graphos/routing/observability/telemetry) exactly the telemetry you want your router to collect and export.

## Using GraphOS Insights

Without enabling additional telemetry, the easiest way to analyze GraphQL operation data is through [GraphOS Insights](/graphos/platform/insights). GraphOS Studio lets you analyze data from failed requests, such as GraphQL error messages ([if enabled](/graphos/routing/graphos-reporting#errors)) and the ID of the client making the request. You can also [segment your insights data](/graphos/platform/insights/client-segmentation) based on the client ID.

## Enabling additional telemetry

Use the methods below if you need information outside of what's presented in GraphOS Studio to debug client requests.

<Note>

If you want to debug client requests in your own environment, Apollo recommends first doing so in a non-production environment or using logic to debug on a per-request basis.

### Telemetry spans and traces

Once you enable [router telemetry](/graphos/routing/observability/telemetry), traces have spans labeled `router`. These spans contain the HTTP information for a given client request via [OpenTelemetry standard attributes](/graphos/reference/router/telemetry/instrumentation/standard-attributes#router) such as `error.type` and `http.response.status_code`.

These attributes include helpful information about the request and response. Spans, however, don't include an attribute for the HTTP body text. If you want to see the GraphQL operation, first check your [GraphOS Insights](/graphos/platform/insights) or use the other options listed below.

### Request and response logging

You can conditionally include the request body in your logs using the [`experimental-when-header`](/graphos/reference/router/telemetry/log-exporters/overview#requestresponse-logging) configuration option.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  exporters:
    logging:
      # If one of these headers matches we will log supergraph and subgraphs requests/responses
      experimental_when_header:
        - name: apollo-router-log-request
          value: my_client
          headers: true # default: false
          body: true # default: false
```

### Debugging router logs

By default, the router uses the `info` level for its logging. [Enabling other logging levels](/graphos/reference/router/telemetry/log-exporters/overview) can help debug specific scenarios. Using non-`info` level configurations is only recommended for local or non-production environments.

### Rhai scripts and coprocessors

Hooking into the `RouterService` layer with either [Rhai scripts](/graphos/routing/customization/rhai) or [coprocessors](/graphos/routing/customization/coprocessor) gives you access to the full HTTP request before processing occurs. You can use either Rhai scripts or coprocessors to add custom logic for what to log and when.

See the Apollo Solutions ["Hello World" coprocessor](https://github.com/apollosolutions/example-coprocessor-helloworld) for an example of a coprocessor that simply logs the router's payload.

### Alternative cloud services

If you are deploying the router to a cloud service, you likely already have access to the raw HTTP logs through other services like load balancers. You should be able to find specific client request logs for a particular operation using the operation hash or trace ID. Refer to the docs for your cloud providers for more information.
